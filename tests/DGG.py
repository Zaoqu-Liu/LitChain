This unique modality of cell death, driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, is regulated by multiple cellular metabolic pathways, including redox homeostasis, iron handling, mitochondrial activity and metabolism of amino acids, lipids and sugars, in addition to various signalling pathways relevant to disease. Numerous organ injuries and degenerative pathologies are driven by ferroptosis. Intriguingly, therapy-resistant cancer cells, particularly those in the mesenchymal state and prone to metastasis, are exquisitely vulnerable to ferroptosis. As such, pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis, via both its induction and its inhibition, holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers, ischaemic organ injuries and other degenerative diseases linked to extensive lipid peroxidation. In this Review, we provide a critical analysis of the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of ferroptosis, the potential physiological functions of ferroptosis in tumour suppression and immune surveillance, and its pathological roles, together with a potential for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, as in all rapidly evolving research areas, challenges exist due to misconceptions and inappropriate experimental methods. This Review also aims to address these issues and to provide practical guidelines for enhancing reproducibility and reliability in studies of ferroptosis. Finally, we discuss important concepts and pressing questions that should be the focus of future ferroptosis research.', 'PMID': '33495651', 'PMCID': 'PMC8142022', 'DOI': '10.1038/s41580-020-00324-8', 'Journal_Title': 'Nature reviews.

Among different forms of RCD, ferroptosis is considered as a type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent regulated necrosis. ROS can react with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the lipid (L) membrane via the formation of a lipid radical L and induce lipid peroxidation to form L-ROS. Ferroptosis is triggered by an imbalance between lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) detoxification and iron-dependent L-ROS accumulation. Intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation are two central biochemical events leading to ferroptosis. Organelles, including mitochondria and lysosomes are involved in the regulation of iron metabolism and redox imbalance in ferroptosis. In this review, we will provide an overview of lipid peroxidation, as well as key components involved in the ferroptotic cascade. The main mechanism that reduces ROS is the redox ability of glutathione (GSH). GSH, a tripeptide that includes glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine, acts as an antioxidant and is the substrate of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is then converted into oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Increasing the expression of GSH can inhibit ferroptosis. We highlight the role of the x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> GSH-GPX4 pathway as the main pathway to regulate ferroptosis. The system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>, composed of subunit solute carrier family members (SLC7A11 and SLC3A2), mediates the exchange of cystine and glutamate across the plasma membrane to synthesize GSH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis requires the autophagy machinery for its execution. Ferritinophagy is used to describe the removal of the major iron storage protein ferritin by the autophagy machinery. Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is a cytosolic autophagy receptor used to bind ferritin for subsequent degradation by ferritinophagy. During ferritinophagy, stored iron released becomes available for biosynthetic pathways. The dysfunctional ferroptotic response is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions.

Since the description of ferroptosis as an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death in 2012, there has been mounting interest in the process and function of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can occur through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent pathway and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. Ferroptosis is caused by a redox imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants, which is driven by the abnormal expression and activity of multiple redox-active enzymes that produce or detoxify free radicals and lipid oxidation products. Accordingly, ferroptosis is precisely regulated at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational layers. The transcription factor NFE2L2 plays a central role in upregulating anti-ferroptotic defense, whereas selective autophagy may promote ferroptotic death.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids are the main substrates of lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis, which is positively regulated by enzymes, such as ACSL4, LPCAT3, ALOXs, or POR.

Unlike other kinds of classical unprogrammed cell death, ferroptosis is primarily linked to disruptions in iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant system imbalance. Ferroptosis is regulated through transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications, which affect cellular sensitivity to ferroptosis. Over the past decade or so, numerous diseases have been linked to ferroptosis as part of their etiology, including cancers, metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal diseases.

Therefore, in-depth analysis of ferroptosis and its potential molecular mechanisms in human diseases may offer additional strategies for clinical prevention and treatment.

In the present study, we sought to investigate whether ferroptosis is involved in the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury and the effects of kaempferol on ferroptosis in OGD/R-treated neurons. Western blot, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze ferroptosis, whereas cell death was detected using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. We found that OGD/R attenuated SLC7A11 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels as well as decreased endogenous antioxidants including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in neurons. Notably, OGD/R enhanced the accumulation of lipid peroxidation, leading to the induction of ferroptosis in neurons.

According to the axiomatic definition of non-accidental cell death, LPO takes place in a scenario of altered homeostasis. FPT, differently from apoptosis, occurs in the absence of any known specific genetically encoded death pathway or specific agonist, and thus must be rated as a regulated, although not "programmed", death pathway. It follows that LPO is under a homeostatic metabolic control and is only permitted when indispensable constraints are satisfied and the antiperoxidant machinery collapses. The activity of the selenoperoxidase Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is the cornerstone of the antiperoxidant defence. Converging evidence on both mechanism of LPO and GPx4 enzymology indicates that LPO is initiated by alkoxyl radicals produced by ferrous iron from the hydroperoxide derivatives of lipids (LOOH), traces of which are the unavoidable drawback of aerobic metabolism. FPT takes place when a threshold has been exceeded. This occurs when the major conditions are satisfied: i) oxygen metabolism leading to the continuous formation of traces of LOOH from phospholipid-containing polyunsaturated fatty acids; ii) missed enzymatic reduction of LOOH; iii) availability of ferrous iron from the labile iron pool. Although the effectors impacting on homeostasis and leading to FPT in physiological conditions are not known, from the available knowledge on LPO and GPx4 enzymology we propose that it is aerobic life itself that, while supporting bioenergetics, is also a critical requisite of FPT.

Iron excess and lipid peroxidation are its primary metabolic features. Therefore, genes involved in iron metabolism and lipid metabolism can regulate iron overload and lipid peroxidation through direct or indirect pathways, thereby regulating ferroptosis. In addition, glutathione (GSH) is the body's primary non-enzymatic antioxidants and plays a pivotal role in the struggle against lipid peroxidation.

We showed that both LPT1 and DFP treatment blocked the ferroptosis markers ACSL4 and ALOX15 in MAFLD mice. Furthermore, LPT1 treatment significantly reduced the liver levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, lipid peroxidation markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and ameliorated the expression of lipid synthesis/oxidation genes (Pparα, Scd1, Fasn, Hmgcr and Cpt1a), insulin resistance, mitochondrial ROS content and liver fibrosis. Importantly, LPT1 treatment potently inhibited hepatic apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-xL ratio and TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cell number), pyroptosis (cleavages of Caspase-1 and GSDMD) and necroptosis (phosphorylation of MLKL). Moreover, LPT1 treatment markedly inhibited cleavages of PANoptosis-related caspase-8 and caspase-6 in MAFLD mouse liver.

We find that ferroptosis negative regulation (FNR) signatures are closely correlated with the progression and chemoresistance of gastric cancer. FNR associated genes (GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1) and STAT3 are upregulated in 5-FU resistant cells and xenografts. Further evidence demonstrates that STAT3 binds to consensus DNA response elements in the promoters of the FNR associated genes (GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1) and regulates their expression, thereby establishing a negative STAT3-ferroptosis regulatory axis in gastric cancer. Genetic inhibition of STAT3 activity triggers ferroptosis through lipid peroxidation and Fe<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in gastric cancer cells. We further develop a potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor, W1131, which demonstrates significant anti-tumor effects in gastric cancer cell xenograft model, organoids model, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) model partly by inducing ferroptosis, thus providing a new candidate compound for advanced gastric cancer.

DPM adapts as frequently as every six weeks, plans proactively for future resistance development, and incorporates multiple therapeutic agents. Simulations indicate that DPM can double mean and median survival and significantly improve long-term survival in a cohort of 3 million virtual patients representing a pan-oncology spectrum. Given the cost and invasiveness of monitoring subclones frequently in the DPM paradigm, we sought to determine the value of a DPM window study of only two six-week adaptations ("moves").\n\nMethods3 million virtual patients, differing in DPM input parameters of initial subclonal compositions, drug sensitivities, and growth and mutational kinetics, were simulated as previously described. Each virtual patient was treated with CPM, DPM, and DPM for two moves followed by CPM.\n\nResultsThe first two DPM moves provide similar benefit to a five-year, 40-move sequence in the full virtual population. In simulations, if the first two moves are identical for DPM and CPM, patients will not benefit from DPM (89% negative predictive value).

Experimental reagents (such as erastin and RSL3), approved drugs (for example, sorafenib, sulfasalazine, statins and artemisinin), ionizing radiation and cytokines (such as IFNγ and TGFβ1) can induce ferroptosis and suppress tumour growth. However, ferroptotic damage can trigger inflammation-associated immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment, thus favouring tumour growth. The extent to which ferroptosis affects tumour biology is unclear, although several studies have found important correlations between mutations in cancer-relevant genes (for example, RAS and TP53), in genes encoding proteins involved in stress response pathways (such as NFE2L2 signalling, autophagy and hypoxia) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and responses to treatments that activate ferroptosis.

Despite the critical role of mitochondria in ferroptosis regulation, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study reveals that the mitochondrial protein METTL17 governs mitochondrial function in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells through epigenetic modulation. Bioinformatic analysis establishes that METTL17 expression positively correlates with ferroptosis resistance in cancer cells and is up-regulated in CRC. Depletion of METTL17 sensitizes CRC cells to ferroptosis, impairs cell proliferation, migration, invasion, xenograft tumor growth, and AOM/DSS-induced CRC tumorigenesis. Furthermore, suppression of METTL17 disrupts mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and enhances intracellular and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and ROS levels during ferroptotic stress. Mechanistically, METTL17 inhibition significantly reduces mitochondrial RNA methylation, including m<sup>4</sup>C, m<sup>5</sup>C, m<sup>3</sup>C, m<sup>7</sup>G, and m<sup>6</sup>A, leading to impaired translation of mitochondrial protein-coding genes.

In this study, the role played by PhosphoGlycerol Dehydrogenase (PHGDH), an important molecule of serine metabolism, was investigated with regard to the regulation of ferroptosis in BCa. <b>Methods:</b> The BCa tissues of 90 patients were analyzed by RNA-sequencing for differential pathways and genes. Western blot, qPCR, and IHC were used to determine PHGDH expression in the cell lines (<i>in vitro</i>) and patient tissues (<i>in vivo</i>). R software was used to analyze PHGDH expression, prognosis, and PHGDH+SLC7A11 score.

Nrf2 activation can not only regulate the expression of a series of antioxidant genes that reduce oxidative stress and its damages, but also directly regulate the genes related to the above pathological processes to combat the corresponding alterations. Therefore, targeting Nrf2 has great potential for the treatment of depression. Activation of Nrf2 has antidepressant effect, but the specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. This article reviews the key role of Nrf2 in depression, focusing on the possible mechanisms of Nrf2 regulating oxidative stress and related pathological processes in depression treatment. Meanwhile, we summarize some natural and synthetic compounds targeting Nrf2 in depression therapy. All the above may provide new insights into targeting Nrf2 for the treatment of depression and provide a broad basis for clinical transformation.', 'PMID': '36335763', 'PMCID': 'PMC9641011', 'DOI': '10.1016/j.redox.2022.102522', 'Journal_Title': 'Redox biology', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Redox Biol', 'Journal_Score': '21.2666666666667', 'ISSN': '2213-2317', 'ArticleDate': '2022-10-31', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36335763/', 'Level': 2}]}]

Ferroptosis has been implicated in a broad set of biological contexts, from development to aging, immunity, and cancer. This review describes key regulators of this form of cell death within a framework of metabolism, ROS biology, and iron biology. Key concepts and major unanswered questions in the ferroptosis field are highlighted.

Morphologically, it is characterized by cellular, organelle and cytoplasmic swelling and the loss of plasma membrane integrity, with the release of intracellular components. Ferroptosis is triggered in cells with dysregulated iron and thiol redox metabolism, whereby the initial robust but selective accumulation of hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids is further propagated through enzymatic and non-enzymatic secondary mechanisms, leading to formation of oxidatively truncated electrophilic species and their adducts with proteins. Thus, ferroptosis is dependent on the convergence of iron, thiol and lipid metabolic pathways. The kidney is particularly susceptible to redox imbalance. A growing body of evidence has linked ferroptosis to acute kidney injury in the context of diverse stimuli, such as ischaemia-reperfusion, sepsis or toxins, and to chronic kidney disease, suggesting that ferroptosis may represent a novel therapeutic target for kidney disease. However, further work is needed to address gaps in our understanding of the triggers, execution and spreading mechanisms of ferroptosis.', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36922653/', 'Title': 'Ferroptotic mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation in the kidney.'}, {'content': 'Cell death can be executed through different subroutines. Since the description of ferroptosis as an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death in 2012, there has been mounting interest in the process and function of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can occur through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent pathway and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. Ferroptosis is caused by a redox imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants, which is driven by the abnormal expression and activity of multiple redox-active enzymes that produce or detoxify free radicals and lipid oxidation products. Accordingly, ferroptosis is precisely regulated at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational layers. The transcription factor NFE2L2 plays a central role in upregulating anti-ferroptotic defense, whereas selective autophagy may promote ferroptotic death. Here, we review current knowledge on the integrated molecular machinery of ferroptosis and describe how dysregulated ferroptosis is involved in cancer, neurodegeneration, tissue injury, inflammation, and infection.', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33268902/', 'Title': 'Ferroptosis: molecular mechanisms and health implications.'}], [{'content': 'Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death driven by loss of activity of the lipid repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and subsequent accumulation of lipid-based reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly lipid hydroperoxides.

According to the axiomatic definition of non-accidental cell death, LPO takes place in a scenario of altered homeostasis. FPT, differently from apoptosis, occurs in the absence of any known specific genetically encoded death pathway or specific agonist, and thus must be rated as a regulated, although not "programmed", death pathway. It follows that LPO is under a homeostatic metabolic control and is only permitted when indispensable constraints are satisfied and the antiperoxidant machinery collapses. The activity of the selenoperoxidase Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is the cornerstone of the antiperoxidant defence. Converging evidence on both mechanism of LPO and GPx4 enzymology indicates that LPO is initiated by alkoxyl radicals produced by ferrous iron from the hydroperoxide derivatives of lipids (LOOH), traces of which are the unavoidable drawback of aerobic metabolism. FPT takes place when a threshold has been exceeded. This occurs when the major conditions are satisfied: i) oxygen metabolism leading to the continuous formation of traces of LOOH from phospholipid-containing polyunsaturated fatty acids; ii) missed enzymatic reduction of LOOH; iii) availability of ferrous iron from the labile iron pool. Although the effectors impacting on homeostasis and leading to FPT in physiological conditions are not known, from the available knowledge on LPO and GPx4 enzymology we propose that it is aerobic life itself that, while supporting bioenergetics, is also a critical requisite of FPT.

Western blot, qPCR, and IHC were used to determine PHGDH expression in the cell lines (<i>in vitro</i>) and patient tissues (<i>in vivo</i>). R software was used to analyze PHGDH expression, prognosis, and PHGDH+SLC7A11 score. The biological functions of PHGDH were examined through organoids, and <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. C11 probes, electron microscopy, and ferroptosis inhibitors/ inducers were used to detect cellular ferroptosis levels. Protein profiling, co-IP, and RIP assays were used to screen proteins that might bind to PHGDH.

Knock-down of PHGDH promoted ferroptosis, while the decreased proliferation of BCa cells. Additionally, PHGDH knock-down downregulated the expression of SLC7A11.

FNR associated genes (GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1) and STAT3 are upregulated in 5-FU resistant cells and xenografts. Further evidence demonstrates that STAT3 binds to consensus DNA response elements in the promoters of the FNR associated genes (GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1) and regulates their expression, thereby establishing a negative STAT3-ferroptosis regulatory axis in gastric cancer. Genetic inhibition of STAT3 activity triggers ferroptosis through lipid peroxidation and Fe<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in gastric cancer cells. We further develop a potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor, W1131, which demonstrates significant anti-tumor effects in gastric cancer cell xenograft model, organoids model, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) model partly by inducing ferroptosis, thus providing a new candidate compound for advanced gastric cancer. Moreover, targeting the STAT3-ferroptosis circuit promotes ferroptosis and restores sensitivity to chemotherapy.

However, its pathway mechanism in AKI is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an RNA-sequence analysis of kidneys in AKI and normal mice to explore the pathway mechanism of ferroptosis. Consequently, differentially expressed genes highlighted Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family (ACSL4), a known promotor for ferroptosis. Besides, RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed its upregulation. HIF-1α was downregulated in I/R-AKI mice, and in vitro studies confirmed a negative regulation of HIF-1α on ACSL4. To explore the role of ACSL4 in AKI, we constructed ACSL4 knockout in kidney tubules of mice-as Cdh16Cre-ACSL4<sup>F/F</sup> mice. Results revealed that ACSL4 knockout significantly reduced ferroptosis and inhibited the functional and pathological injury of AKI mice. Meanwhile, the kidneys of Cdh16Cre-ACSL4<sup>F/F</sup> mice demonstrated a significantly decreased inflammation and macrophage infiltration. Further, additional explorations were explored to decipher a more thorough understanding of ferroptotic immunogenicity. As a result, neutrophils were not directly recruited by ferroptotic cells, but by ferroptotic cell-induced macrophages. Further, ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone significantly inhibited AKI.

Here we revealed a crucial role of S-palmitoylation in regulating ferroptosis through glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a pivotal enzyme that mitigates lipid peroxidation. We identified that zinc finger DHHC-domain containing protein 8 (zDHHC8), an S-acyltransferase that is highly expressed in multiple tumors, palmitoylates GPX4 at Cys75. Through small-molecule drug screening, we identified PF-670462, a zDHHC8-specific inhibitor that promotes the degradation of zDHHC8, consequently attenuating GPX4 palmitoylation and enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity. PF-670462 inhibition of zDHHC8 facilitates the CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cell-induced ferroptosis of tumor cells, thereby improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in a B16-F10 xenograft model.

Many pathological conditions are linked to imbalances in redox homeostasis, illustrating the important role of antioxidant defense systems in preventing the pathogenic effects associated with the accumulation of reactive species. In particular, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the accumulation of lipid peroxides has an important role in driving the pathogenesis of multiple disease states. A key example of this is the recent discovery of a novel form of cell death termed ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven cell death cascade that has become a key target in the development of anti-cancer therapies, as well as the prevention of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of lipid peroxidation, as well as key components involved in the ferroptotic cascade.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, also known as NRF2) is key for cellular antioxidant responses, which promotes downstream genes transcription by binding to their antioxidant response elements (AREs). Numerous studies suggest that NRF2 assumes an extremely important role in the regulation of ferroptosis, for its various functions in iron, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, and so on. Many pathological states are relevant to ferroptosis. Abnormal suppression of ferroptosis is found in many cases of cancer, promoting their progression and metastasis. While during tissue damages, ferroptosis is recurrently promoted, resulting in a large number of cell deaths and even dysfunctions of the corresponding organs. Therefore, targeting NRF2-related signaling pathways, to induce or inhibit ferroptosis, has become a great potential therapy for combating cancers, as well as preventing neurodegenerative and ischemic diseases. In this review, a brief overview of the research process of ferroptosis over the past decade will be presented.
