Although the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumor development and therapeutic response, our understanding of the individual TME components, especially cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), remains limited. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed CRC-LM CAFs and cancer cells by single-cell transcriptomics and used bioinformatics for data analysis and integration with related available single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. We validated key findings by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. <b>Results:</b> By single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 4,397 CAFs from six CRC-LM samples, we identified two main CAF populations, contractile CAFs and extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs, and four subpopulations with distinct phenotypes. We found that ECM-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs derive from portal resident fibroblasts. They associate with areas of strong desmoplastic reaction and Wnt signaling in low-proliferating tumor cells engulfed in a stiff extracellular matrix.

We systematically outline the intricate web of interactions among CAFs, tumor cells, and other TME components, and based on this complex interplay, we summarize various therapeutic strategies designed to target CAFs in CRC.

We systematically outline the intricate web of interactions among CAFs, tumor cells, and other TME components, and based on this complex interplay, we summarize various therapeutic strategies designed to target CAFs in CRC.

Although Wnt signaling has been intensively studied in colorectal cancer, it remains unclear whether activity in the tumor-associated stroma contributes to malignancy. To specifically interfere with stromal signals, we generated Wnt-independent tumor organoids that secrete the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1. Subcutaneous transplantation into immunocompetent as well as immunodeficient mice resulted in a strong reduction of tumor growth. Histologic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that Sfrp1 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in tumor cells without affecting tumor-intrinsic Wnt signaling, suggesting involvement of nonimmune stromal cells. Blockage of canonical signaling using Sfrp1, Dkk1, or fibroblast-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin strongly decreased the number of cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAF). Wnt activity in CAFs was linked with distinct subtypes, where low and high levels induced an inflammatory-like CAF (iCAF) subtype or contractile myCAFs, respectively. Coculture of tumor organoids with iCAFs resulted in significant upregulation of EMT markers, while myCAFs reverted this phenotype. In summary, we show that tumor growth and malignancy are differentially regulated via distinct fibroblast subtypes under the influence of juxtacrine Wnt signals. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence for Wnt-induced functional diversity of colorectal cancer-associated fibroblasts, representing a non-cell autonomous mechanism for colon cancer progression.

While 5-HT primarily exerts its effects through binding to various 5-HT receptors, receptor-independent mechanisms such as serotonylation remain unclear. This study revealed that depleting 5-HT, either through genetic silencing of Tph1 or using a selective TPH1 inhibitor, effectively reduced the growth of CRC tumors. Interestingly, although intrinsic 5-HT synthesis exists in CRC, it is circulating 5-HT that mediates the cancer-promoting function of 5-HT. Blocking the function of 5-HT receptors showed that the oncogenic roles of 5-HT in CRC operate through a mechanism that is separate from its receptor. Instead, serotonylation of histone H3Q5 (H3Q5ser) was found in CRC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). H3Q5ser triggers a phenotypic switch of CAFs towards an inflammatory-like CAF (iCAF) subtype, which further enhances CRC cell proliferation, invasive characteristics, and macrophage polarization. Knockdown of the 5-HT transporter SLC22A3 or inhibition of TGM2 reduces H3Q5ser levels and reverses the tumor-promoting phenotypes of CAFs in CRC. Collectively, this study sheds light on the serotonylation-dependent mechanisms of 5-HT in CRC progression, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting the serotonin pathway for CRC treatment.', 'PMID': '39097134', 'DOI': 'S0304-3835(24)00545-7', 'Journal_Title': 'Cancer letters', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Cancer Lett', 'Journal_Score': '10.8666666666667', 'ISSN': '1872-7980', 'ArticleDate': '2024-08-02', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39097134/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'FOS-driven inflammatory CAFs promote colorectal cancer liver metastasis via the SFRP1-FGFR2-HIF1 axis.', 'Abstract': '<b>Rationale:</b> Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit diverse functions, yet their roles in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remain poorly understood. <b>Methods:</b> Through integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics from colorectal cancer patients (CRCP: non-metastatic primary tumors; CRCM: metastatic primary tumors with liver metastases), combined with <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models to investigate the role of CAFs in CRLM. <i>In vitro</i> experiments included six groups to reveal the role of SFRP1-producing CAFs, comprising PBS (control) and recombinant human SFRP1 (rhSFRP1) treated SW480 cells, PBS (control) and recombinant mouse SFRP1 (rmSFRP1) treated CT26 cells, and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAF-NC and CAF-Sfrp1 treated CT26 cells.

Although the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumor development and therapeutic response, our understanding of the individual TME components, especially cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), remains limited. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed CRC-LM CAFs and cancer cells by single-cell transcriptomics and used bioinformatics for data analysis and integration with related available single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. We validated key findings by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. <b>Results:</b> By single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 4,397 CAFs from six CRC-LM samples, we identified two main CAF populations, contractile CAFs and extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs, and four subpopulations with distinct phenotypes. We found that ECM-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs derive from portal resident fibroblasts.

The tumor microenvironment exerts crucial effects in driving CRC progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serve as one of the most important tumor microenvironment components promoting CRC progression. This study aimed to elucidate the novel molecular mechanisms of CAF-secreted insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Our results indicated that IGF2 was a prominent factor upregulated in CAFs compared with normal fibroblasts. CAF-derived conditioned media (CM) promoted tumor growth, migration, and invasion of HCT 116 and DLD-1 cells. IGF1R expression is significantly increased in CRC, serving as a potent receptor in response to IGF2 stimulation and predicting unfavorable outcomes for CRC patients. Apart from the PI3K-AKT pathway, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the YAP1-target signature serves as a prominent downstream effector to mediate the oncogenic signaling of IGF2-IGF1R. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunohistochemical validation, IGF2 was found to be predominantly secreted by CAFs, whereas IGF1R was expressed mainly by cancer cells. IGF2 triggers the nuclear accumulation of YAP1 and upregulates YAP1 target signatures; however, these effects were abolished by either IGF1R knockdown or inhibition with picropodophyllin (PPP), an IGF1R inhibitor. Using CRC organoid and in vivo studies, we found that cotargeting IGF1R and YAP1 with PPP and verteporfin (VP), a YAP1 inhibitor, enhanced antitumor effects compared with PPP treatment alone. In conclusion, this study revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which CAFs promote CRC progression. The findings highlight the translational potential of the IGF2-IGF1R-YAP1 axis as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC. \xa9 2022 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.', 'PMID': '36373776', 'DOI': '10.1002/path.6033', 'Journal_Title': 'The Journal of pathology', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'J Pathol', 'Journal_Score': '12.8571428571429', 'ISSN': '1096-9896', 'ArticleDate': '2022-12-17', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36373776/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'IL-15-secreting CAR natural killer cells directed toward the pan-cancer target CD70 eliminate both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Abstract': 'It remains challenging to obtain positive outcomes with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered cell therapies in solid malignancies, like colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
