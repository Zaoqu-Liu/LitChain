However, the mechanisms through which CSCs orchestrate the dynamics of the tumor stroma during HCC development remain elusive. Our study unveils a significant upregulation of Sema3C in fibrotic liver, HCC tissues, peripheral blood of HCC patients, as well as sorafenib-resistant tissues and cells, with its overexpression correlating with the acquisition of stemness properties in HCC. We further identify NRP1 and ITGB1 as pivotal functional receptors of Sema3C, activating downstream AKT/Gli1/c-Myc signaling pathways to bolster HCC self-renewal and tumor initiation. Additionally, HCC cells-derived Sema3C facilitated extracellular matrix (ECM) contraction and collagen deposition in vivo, while also promoting the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Mechanistically, Sema3C interacted with NRP1 and ITGB1 in HSCs, activating downstream NF-kB signaling, thereby stimulating the release of IL-6 and upregulating HMGCR expression, consequently enhancing cholesterol synthesis in HSCs. Furthermore, CAF-secreted TGF-β1 activates AP1 signaling to augment Sema3C expression in HCC cells, establishing a positive feedback loop that accelerates HCC progression. Notably, blockade of Sema3C effectively inhibits tumor growth and sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib in vivo. In sum, our findings spotlight Sema3C as a novel biomarker facilitating the crosstalk between CSCs and stroma during hepatocarcinogenesis, thereby offering a promising avenue for enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming drug resistance in HCC.', 'PMID': '38956074', 'PMCID': 'PMC11220018', 'DOI': '10.1038/s41392-024-01887-0', 'Journal_Title': 'Signal transduction and targeted therapy', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Signal Transduct Target Ther', 'Journal_Score': '319.0', 'ISSN': '2059-3635', 'ArticleDate': '2024-07-03', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38956074/', 'Level': 2}, {'Title': 'Semaphorin 3C exacerbates liver fibrosis.', 'Abstract': 'Chronic liver disease is a growing epidemic, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Advanced single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) could reveal the complex architecture and interaction with the microenvironment in early DKD. We used scRNA-seq to investigate early changes in the kidney of db/m mice and db/db mice at the 14th week. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection were applied to classify cells into different clusters at a proper resolution. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify the key molecules specifically expressed in kidney tubules. Information of cell-cell communication within the kidney was obtained using receptor-ligand pairing resources. In vitro model, human subjects, and co-detection by indexing staining were used to identify the pathophysiologic role of the hub genes in DKD. Among four distinct subsets of the proximal tubule (PT), lower percentages of proliferative PT and PT containing AQP4 expression (PT<sup>AQP4+</sup>) in db/db mice induced impaired cell repair activity and dysfunction of renin-angiotensin system modulation in early DKD. We found that ferroptosis was involved in DKD progression, and ceruloplasmin acted as a central regulator of the induction of ferroptosis in PT<sup>AQP4+</sup>. In addition, lower percentages of thick ascending limbs and collecting ducts with impaired metabolism function were also critical pathogenic features in the kidney of db/db mice. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) mediated pathogenic cross-talk in the tubular microenvironment, as validated by a correlation between urinary SPP1/Cr level and tubular injury. Finally, mesangial cell-derived semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) further promoted endothelium-mesenchymal transition in glomerular endothelial cells through NRP1 and NRP2, and urinary SEMA3C/Cr level was positively correlated with glomerular injury.

To characterize the function of ADAMTS1, we performed two alternative proteomic approaches, difference gel electrophoresis and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, to identify novel substrates of the metalloprotease. Both techniques showed that overexpression of ADAMTS1 leads to the release of semaphorin 3C from the extracellular matrix. Although semaphorins are well known regulators of axon guidance, accumulating evidence shows that they may also participate in tumor progression. Here, we show that the cleavage of semaphorin 3C induced by ADAMTS1 promotes the migration of breast cancer cells, indicating that the co-expression of these molecules in tumors may contribute to the metastatic program.', 'PMID': '19915008', 'PMCID': 'PMC2807303', 'DOI': '10.1074/jbc.M109.055129', 'Journal_Title': 'The Journal of biological chemistry', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'J Biol Chem', 'Journal_Score': '2.79824561403509', 'ISSN': '1083-351X', 'ArticleDate': '2009-11-13', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19915008/', 'Level': 1}]}, {'biorxiv': [], 'medrxiv': [], 'pubmed': [{'Title': 'Emerging roles and mechanisms of semaphorins activity in cancer.', 'Abstract': 'Semaphorins are regulatory molecules that are linked to the modulation of several cancer processes, such as angiogenesis, cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, tumor growth, as well as cancer cell survival.

Here, we reveal a crosstalk between motor neurons (MNs) and endothelial cells (ECs), necessary for the coordinated development of MNs. By analyzing cell-to-cell interaction profiles of the mouse developing spinal cord, we uncovered semaphorin 3C (Sema3C) and PlexinD1 as a communication axis between MNs and ECs. Using cell-specific knockout mice and in\xa0vitro assays, we demonstrate that removal of Sema3C in MNs, or its receptor PlexinD1 in ECs, results in premature and aberrant vascularization of MN columns. Those vascular defects impair MN axon exit from the spinal cord. Impaired PlexinD1 signaling in ECs also causes MN maturation defects at later stages.

Sema3C directs β-catenin nuclear accumulation in a Rac1-dependent process, leading to transactivation of Wnt target genes. Sema3C-driven Wnt signaling occurred despite suppression of Wnt ligand secretion, suggesting that Sema3C drives canonical Wnt signaling independent of Wnt ligand binding. In a mouse model of glioblastoma, combined depletion of Sema3C and β-catenin partner TCF1 extended animal survival more than single target inhibition alone.

However, the immune cells and immune related genes involved in BE development and progression are not fully understood. Therefore, our study attempted to investigate the roles of immune cells and immune related genes in BE patients. The raw gene expression data were downloaded from the GEO database. The limma package in R was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF) analyses to screen key genes. The proportion of infiltrated immune cells was evaluated using the CIBERSORT algorithm between BE and normal esophagus (NE) samples. The spearman index was used to show the correlations of immune genes and immune cells. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic value of key genes in BE. A total of 103 differentially expressed immune-related genes were identified between BE samples and normal samples. Then, 7 genes (CD1A, LTF, FABP4, PGC, TCF7L2, INSR,SEMA3C) were obtained after Lasso analysis and RF modeling. CIBERSORT analysis revealed that resting CD4 T memory cells and gamma delta T cells were present at significantly lower levels in BE samples. Moreover, plasma cell and regulatory T cells were present at significantly higher levels in BE samples than in NE samples. INSR had the highest AUC values in ROC analysis. We identified 7 immune related genes and 4 different immune cells in our study, that may play vital roles in the occurrence and development of BE.

We here report that human malignant glioma cell lines express neuropilins 1 and 2 mRNA and protein, as well as either plexin A1, A2, or B1.

Targeting mutated KRAS, the most renowned driver gene in pancreatic cancer, is an active area of study. We discovered a gene named SEMA3C was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and patients with a G12D mutation in KRAS. High expression of SEMA3C in patients was significantly associated with the decreased survival of pancreatic cancer patients based on the TCGA database. In pancreatic cancer cells, SEMA3C knockdown or inhibition exhibited growth/colony inhibition and cell cycle arrest. In addition, SEMA3C inhibition sensitized KRAS or MEK1/2 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression of SEMA3C resulted in the induction of autophagy, whereas depletion of SEMA3C compromised induction of autophagy. SEMA3C modified the PD-L1 expression in tumor and immune cells and is correlated with the M2-like macrophage marker ARG1/CD163 expression, which could reshape the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of SEMA3C decreased tumor formation in the xenograft model <i>in vivo</i>. Taken together, our data suggest that SEMA3C plays a substantial role in promoting cancer cell survival by regulating the autophagy process and impacting the tumor environment immune response.

However, few studies have addressed the efficacy of immunotherapy for LUAD. Here, a novel method for predicting immunotherapy efficacy has been proposed, which combines single-cell and bulk sequencing to characterize the immune microenvironment and metabolic profile of LUAD. TCGA bulk dataset was used to cluster two immune subtypes: C1 with "cold" tumor characteristics and C2 with "hot" tumor characteristics, with different prognosis. The Scissor algorithm, which is based on these two immune subtypes, identified GSE131907 single cell dataset into two groups of epithelial cells, labeled as Scissor_C1 and Scissor_C2. The enrichment revealed that Scissor_C1 was characterized by hypoxia, and a hypoxic microenvironment is a potential inducing factor for tumor invasion, metastasis, and immune therapy non-response. Furthermore, single cell analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of hypoxic microenvironment-induced invasion, metastasis, and immune therapy non-response in LUAD. Notably, Scissor_C1 cells significantly interacted with T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), and exhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immunosuppressive features. CellChat analysis revealed that a hypoxic microenvironment in Scissor_C1elevated TGFβ signaling and induced ANGPTL4 and SEMA3C secretion. Interaction with endothelial cells with ANGPTL4, which increases vascular permeability and achieves distant metastasis across the vascular endothelium. Additionally, interaction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and Scissor_C1 <i>via</i> the EREG/EFGR pathway induces tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug-resistance in patients with LAUD. Thereafter, a subgroup of CAF cells that exhibited same features as those of Scissor_C1 that exert immunosuppressive functions in the tumor microenvironment were identified. Moreover, the key genes (<i>EPHB2</i> and <i>COL1A1</i>) in the Scissor_C1 gene network were explored and their expressions were verified using immunohistochemistry. Finally, the metabolism dysfunction in cells crosstalk was determined, which is characterized by glutamine secretion by TAM and uptake by Scissor_C1 <i>via</i> SLC38A2 transporter, which may induce glutamine addiction in LUAD cells.

Both AR and GR have a role in resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the mainstay of treatment for late stage prostate cancer. PlexinB1, a receptor for semaphorins, has been implicated in various cancers including prostate cancer and has a role in resistance to ADT. We show here that activation of PlexinB1 by Sema4D and Sema3C results in translocation of endogenous GR to the nucleus in prostate cancer cells, and that this effect is dependent on PlexinB1 expression. Sema4D/Sema3C promotes the translocation of GR-GFP to the nucleus and mutation of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS1) of GR abrogates this response. These findings implicate the importin α/β system in the Sema4D/Sema3C-mediated nuclear import of GR. Knockdown of PlexinB1 in prostate cancer cells decreases the levels of glucocorticoid-responsive gene products and antagonizes the decrease in cell motility and cell area of prostate cancer cells upon dexamethasone treatment, demonstrating the functional significance of these findings.
