Characterizing the spatial organization and interactions of CAFs within complex tissue environments provides critical insights into tumor biology and immunobiology. In this study, through integrative analyses of over 14 million cells from 10 cancer types across 7 spatial transcriptomics and proteomics platforms, we discover, validate, and characterize four distinct spatial CAF subtypes. These subtypes are conserved across cancer types and independent of spatial omics platforms. Notably, they exhibit distinct spatial organizational patterns, neighboring cell compositions, interaction networks, and transcriptomic profiles. Their abundance and composition vary across tissues, shaping TME characteristics, such as levels, distribution, and state composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, tumor immune phenotypes, and patient survival.

Early diagnosis leads to better survival rates, but this requires an improved understanding of the molecular changes during early tumorigenesis, particularly in nonsmokers. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of samples from 94 East Asian patients with precancerous lesions [25 with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH); 69 with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)] and 73 patients with early invasive lesions [minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)]. Cellular analysis revealed that the activities of endothelial and stromal cells could be used to categorize tumors into molecular subtypes within pathologically defined types of lesions. The subtypes were linked with the radiologically defined type of lesions and corresponded to immune cell infiltration throughout the early progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed the distribution of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and plasma cells within MIA samples. Characterization of the molecular lesion subtypes identified positively selected mutational patterns and suggested that angiogenesis in the late-stage AIS type potentially contributes to tissue invasion of the MIA type. This study offers a resource that may help improve early diagnosis and patient prognosis, and the findings suggest possible approaches for early disease interception.

It is possible to propose a better treatment strategy when the heterogeneity of the patient is accounted for during subgroup identification, irrespective of the tissue of origin. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) based pipeline for subgroup identification in pan-cancer. Here, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and protein expression features from pan-cancer samples were concatenated and non-linearly projected to a lower dimension using an ML algorithm. This data was then clustered to identify multi-omics-based novel subgroups. The clinical characterization of these ML subgroups indicated significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p-value<0.0001). The subgroups formed by the patients from different tumors shared similar molecular alterations in terms of immune microenvironment, mutation profile, and enriched pathways. Further, decision-level and feature-level fused classification models were built to identify the novel subgroups for unseen samples. Additionally, the classification models were used to obtain the class labels for the validation samples, and the molecular characteristics were verified. To summarize, this work identified novel ML subgroups using multi-omics data and showed that the patients with different tumor types could be similar molecularly.

Traditional methods typically use linear regression models with clear assumptions; such methods are unable to capture the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. Non-linear models (e.g., deep neural networks) have been proposed as a superior alternative to linear models because they can capture complex non-additive effects. Here we\xa0introduce a deep learning (DL) method, deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP), for integration of multi-omics data in plants.

Second, the multilayered hierarchical structure of DNNGP dynamically learns features from raw data, avoiding overfitting and improving the convergence rate using a batch normalization\xa0layer\xa0and early stopping and rectified linear activation (rectified linear unit) functions.

These systems are generally suitable for broad assessments but lack condition-specific applicability and fail to capture the risks associated with dynamic changes in patient conditions. Future research in this field is poised for deep exploration into the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with routine clinical and multi-omics data in patients with cirrhosis. The goal is to transition from static, unimodal assessment models to dynamic, multimodal frameworks. Such advancements will not only improve the precision of prognostic tools but also facilitate personalized medicine approaches, potentially revolutionizing clinical outcomes.', 'PMID': '39402630', 'DOI': '10.1186/s12967-024-05726-2', 'Journal_Title': 'Journal of translational medicine', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'J Transl Med', 'Journal_Score': '8.125', 'ISSN': '1479-5876', 'ArticleDate': '2024-10-14', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39402630/', 'Level': 2}, {'Title': 'GREMI: An Explainable Multi-Omics Integration Framework for Enhanced Disease Prediction and Module Identification.', 'Abstract': 'Multi-omics integration has demonstrated promising performance in complex disease prediction. However, existing research typically focuses on maximizing prediction accuracy, while often neglecting the essential task of discovering meaningful biomarkers. This issue is particularly important in biomedicine, as molecules often interact rather than function individually to influence disease outcomes. To this end, we propose a two-phase framework named GREMI to assist multi-omics classification and explanation. In the prediction phase, we propose to improve prediction performance by employing a graph attention architecture on sample-wise co-functional networks to incorporate biomolecular interaction information for enhanced feature representation, followed by the integration of a joint-late mixed strategy and the true-class-probability block to adaptively evaluate classification confidence at both feature and omics levels. In the interpretation phase, we propose a multi-view approach to explain disease outcomes from the interaction module perspective, providing a more intuitive understanding and biomedical rationale. We incorporate Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to explore local-view subgraphs and pinpoint modules that highly contribute to disease characterization from the global-view. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in seven different classification tasks, and our model effectively addresses data mutual interference when the number of omics types increases.

The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome).

To begin to understand the mechanisms involving estrogenic metabolic effects, we compared cell number, viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis among HCC-derived HepG2 cells that were treated with different concentrations of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) that blocks glucose metabolism, oxamate that inhibits lactate dehydrogenase and glycolysis, or oligomycin that blocks ATP synthesis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We confirmed that HepG2 cells primarily utilized glycolysis followed by lactate fermentation, instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, for cell growth. We hypothesized that estrogen altered energy metabolism via its receptors to carry out its anticancer effects in HepG2 cells.

This computational model of spatial quantitative systems pharmacology was designed to simulate the effects of combination immunotherapy. The model was initiated using literature-derived parameter values and fitted to the specifics of HCC. Model validation was done through comparison with spatial multiomics data from a neoadjuvant HCC clinical trial combining anti-PD1 immunotherapy and a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib. Validation using spatial proteomics data from imaging mass cytometry demonstrated that closer proximity between CD8 T cells and macrophages correlated with nonresponse. We also compared the model output with Visium spatial transcriptomics profiling of samples from posttreatment tumor resections in the clinical trial and from another independent study of anti-PD1 monotherapy. Spatial transcriptomics data confirmed simulation results, suggesting the importance of spatial patterns of tumor vasculature and TGFβ in tumor and immune cell interactions. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating mathematical modeling and computer simulations with high-throughput spatial multiomics data provides a novel approach for patient outcome prediction and biomarker discovery.

The goal of PM is to facilitate diagnosis, predict effective therapy, and avoid adverse reactions specific for each patient. The forefront of PM is in oncology; nonetheless, it is developing in other fields of medicine, including rheumatology. Recent studies on elucidating the genetic architecture of polygenic and monogenic rheumatological diseases have made PM possible by enabling physicians to customize medical treatment through the incorporation of clinical features and genetic data. For complex inflammatory disorders, the prevailing paradigm is that disease susceptibility is due to additive effects of common reduced-penetrance gene variants and environmental factors. Efforts have been made to calculate cumulative genetic risk score (GRS) and to relate specific susceptibility alleles for use of target therapies. The discovery of rare patients with single-gene high-penetrance mutations informed our understanding of pathways driving systemic inflammation.

This review examines how feature selection techniques address these challenges by improving the interpretability and performance of machine learning (ML) models in high-dimensional datasets. Feature selection methods-such as filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques-play a critical role in enhancing the precision of cancer diagnostics by identifying relevant biomarkers. The integration of multi-omics data and ML algorithms facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity, advancing both diagnostics and personalized therapies. However, challenges such as ensuring data quality, mitigating overfitting, and addressing scalability remain critical limitations of these methods. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered feature selection offers promising solutions to these issues by automating and refining the feature extraction process. This review highlights the transformative potential of these approaches while emphasizing future directions, including the incorporation of deep learning (DL) models and integrative multi-omics strategies for more robust and reproducible findings.", 'PMID': '39858475', 'DOI': '10.3390/biom15010081', 'Journal_Title': 'Biomolecules', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Biomolecules', 'Journal_Score': '4.25333333333333', 'ISSN': '2218-273X', 'ArticleDate': '2025-01-08', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39858475/', 'Level': 2}]}]
