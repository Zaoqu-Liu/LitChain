Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME. In addition, we present current related CAF-targeting immunotherapies and briefly describe some future perspectives on CAF research in the end.', 'PMID': '34635121', 'DOI': '10.1186/s12943-021-01428-1', 'Journal_Title': 'Molecular cancer', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Mol Cancer', 'Journal_Score': '79.75', 'ISSN': '1476-4598', 'ArticleDate': '2021-10-11', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34635121/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'Pan-cancer spatially resolved single-cell analysis reveals the crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor microenvironment.', 'Abstract': 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous cell population that plays a crucial role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Additionally, the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from three additional common cancer types and two newly generated scRNA-seq datasets of rare cancer types, namely epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), expanded our understanding of CAF heterogeneity.

The mechanism of CAF heterogeneity in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear and has slowed translational advances in targeting CAFs.

The spatial distribution of the CAF subsets in different Lauren subtypes of GC, as well as the neighborhood relations between these CAF subsets and the protumor immune cell subsets were evaluated by performing multistaining registration. <b>Results:</b> Tumor epithelial cells exhibited significant intratumor and intertumor variabilities, while CAFs mainly exhibited intratumor variability.

These four CAF subsets shared similar properties with their resident fibroblast counterparts in the adjacent mucosa but also exhibited enhanced protumor activities. Additionally, two CAF subsets, inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) and extracellular matrix CAFs (eCAFs), communicated with adjacent immune cell subsets in the GC TME. iCAFs interacted with T cells by secreting interleukin (IL)-6 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), while eCAFs correlated with M2 macrophages via the expression of periostin (POSTN). eCAFs, which function as a pro-invasive CAF subset, decreased the overall survival time of patients with GC. <b>Conclusions:</b> iCAFs and eCAFs not only exhibited enhanced pro-invasive activities but also mobilized the surrounding immune cells to construct a tumor-favorable microenvironment.

In this comprehensive review, we presented the origins and activation mechanisms of CAFs in CRC, elaborating on how CAFs drive tumor progression through their interactions with CRC cells, immune cells, vascular endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix within the TME. We systematically outline the intricate web of interactions among CAFs, tumor cells, and other TME components, and based on this complex interplay, we summarize various therapeutic strategies designed to target CAFs in CRC. It is also essential to recognize that CAFs represent a highly heterogeneous group, encompassing various subtypes such as myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF), inflammatory CAF (iCAF), antigen-presenting CAF (apCAF), vessel-associated CAF (vCAF). Herein, we provide a summary of studies investigating the heterogeneity of CAFs in CRC and the characteristic expression patterns of each subtype. While the majority of CAFs contribute to the exacerbation of CRC malignancy, recent findings have revealed specific subtypes that exert inhibitory effects on CRC progression.

To address this problem, we developed the first <i>in vitro</i> microfluidic human Prostate-Cancer-on-Chip (PCoC) model, where human prostate cancer and stromal fibroblast cells were co-cultivated in two channels separated by a porous membrane under culture medium flow.

Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that tumor cells induced CAF biomarkers, αSMA and COL1A1, in stromal fibroblasts. The stromal CAF conversion level was observed to increase along the flow direction in response to diffusion agents, consistent with simulations of solute concentration gradients. The tumor cells also downregulated androgen receptor (AR) expression in stromal fibroblasts, while an adequate level of stromal AR expression is maintained in normal prostate homeostasis. We further investigated tumor invasion into the stroma, an early step in the metastatic cascade, in devices featuring a serpentine channel with orthogonal channel segments overlaying a straight channel and separated by an 8\xa0\xb5m-pore membrane. Both tumor cells and stromal CAFs were observed to cross over into their neighboring channel, and the stroma's role seemed to be proactive in promoting cell invasion.

The structure of the tumor stroma includes connective tissue elements, blood vessels, nerves, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Some of the cellular elements of the tumor stroma are cancer-associated f ibroblasts (CAFs). The origin and function of CAFs have been actively studied over the past thirty years. CAFs produce collagen, the main scaffold protein of the extracellular matrix. Collagen in the tumor stroma stimulates f ibrosis, enhances the rigidity of tumor tissue, and disrupts the transmission of proliferation and differentiation signaling pathways. CAFs control tumor angiogenesis, cell motility, tumor immunogenic properties, and the development of resistance to chemo- and immunotherapy. As a result of metabolic adaptation of rapidly growing tumor tissue to the nutrients and oxygen deprivation, the main type of energy production in cells changes from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis. These changes lead to sequential molecular alterations, including the induction of specif ied transcriptional factors that result in the CAFs activation. The molecular phenotype of activated CAFs is similar to f ibroblasts activated during inf lammation. In activated CAFs, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is synthetized de novo and various proteases and f ibronectin are produced. Since CAFs are found in all types of carcinomas, these cells are potential targets for the development of new approaches for anticancer therapy. Some CAFs originate from resident f ibroblasts of the organs invaded by the tumor, while others originate from epithelial tumor cells, which are undergoing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Spacia unveiled how endothelial cells, fibroblasts and B cells in the tumor microenvironment contribute to Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer cells. We deployed spacia in a set of pan-cancer datasets and showed that B cells also participate in <i>PDL1</i>/<i>PD1</i> signaling in tumors. We demonstrated that a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell/<i>PDL1</i> effectiveness signature derived from spacia analyses is associated with patient survival and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments in 3,354 patients.

Here, we divide the sporadic colon cancer tissue samples with transcriptomic data into patients diagnosed with EOCC (<50\u2009yrs) and late-onset colon cancer (LOCC, ≥50\u2009yrs) and then, analyze the data using CIBERSORTx deconvolution software. EOCC tumors are more enriched in CAFs with fibroblast associated protein positive expression (FAP(+)) than LOCC tumors. EOCC patients with higher FAP mRNA levels in CAFs have shorter OS (Log-rank test, p\u2009<\u20090.029). Spatial transcriptomic analysis of 112 areas of interest, using NanoString GeoMx digital spatial profiling, demonstrate that FAP(+) CAFs at the EOCC tumor invasive margin show a significant upregulation of WNT signaling and higher mRNA/protein levels of fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20). Tumor epithelial cells at tumor invasive margin of EOCC tumors neighboring FAP(+) CAFs show significantly higher mRNA/protein levels of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR2) and PI3K/Akt signaling activation.

By integrating the scRNA-seq results with ST, the presence of iCAF in chordoma tissue was further confirmed, indicating their positioning at a distance from the tumor cells. Bulk RNA-seq data analysis from 126 patients revealed a correlation between iCAF signature scores, chordoma invasiveness, and poor prognosis. QIF validation involving an additional 116 patients found that although iCAFs were not in close proximity to tumor cells compared with other CAF subsets, their density correlated with malignant tumor phenotypes and adverse outcomes. In vivo and in vitro experiments further confirmed that iCAFs accelerate the malignant progression of chordomas. These findings could provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies. \xa9 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.', 'PMID': '39611243', 'DOI': '10.1002/path.6369', 'Journal_Title': 'The Journal of pathology', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'J Pathol', 'Journal_Score': '12.8571428571429', 'ISSN': '1096-9896', 'ArticleDate': '2024-11-29', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611243/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Malignancies and Immune Escape: The Role of the Tumor Microenvironment and Tumor Cell Evasion Strategies.', 'Abstract': 'The detailed mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the initiation and progression of EBV-associated malignancies are not yet completely understood. During the last years, new insights into the mechanisms of malignant transformation of EBV-infected cells including somatic mutations and epigenetic modifications, their impact on the microenvironment and resulting unique immune signatures related to immune system functional status and immune escape strategies have been reported. In this context, there exists increasing evidence that EBV-infected tumor cells can influence the tumor microenvironment to their own benefit by establishing an immune-suppressive surrounding. The identified mechanisms include EBV gene integration and latent expression of EBV-infection-triggered cytokines by tumor and/or bystander cells, e.g., cancer-associated fibroblasts with effects on the composition and spatial distribution of the immune cell subpopulations next to the infected cells, stroma constituents and extracellular vesicles. This review summarizes (i) the typical stages of the viral life cycle and EBV-associated transformation, (ii) strategies to detect EBV genome and activity and to differentiate various latency types, (iii) the role of the tumor microenvironment in EBV-associated malignancies, (iv) the different immune escape mechanisms and (v) their clinical relevance.

However, the changes of the cellular and molecular components of liver tumors in comparison with normal livers have not been described at single-cell level. Here, we performed an integrative single-cell analysis of both normal livers and liver cancers. Principal component analysis was firstly performed to delineate the cell lineages in liver tissues. Differential gene expression within major cell types were then analyzed between tumor and normal samples, thus resolved the cell type-specific molecular alterations in liver cancer development. Moreover, a comparison between liver cancer derived versus normal liver derived cell components revealed that two subpopulations of fibroblasts were exclusively expanded in liver cancer tissues. By further defining subpopulation-specific gene signatures, characterizing their spatial distribution in tumor tissues and investigating their clinical significance, we found that the SPARCL1 positive fibroblasts, representing a group of tumor vessel associated fibroblasts, were related to reduced vascular invasion and prolonged survival of liver cancer patients. Through establishing an in-vitro endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition model, we verified the conversion of the fetal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells into the fibroblast-like cells, demonstrating a possible endothelial cell origination of the SPARCL1 positive fibroblasts.
