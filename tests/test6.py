For pulmonary nodule detection, computer-aided detection (CADe) tools have been commercially available since the early 2000s. The more recent rise of deep learning and the availability of large annotated lung nodule datasets have allowed the development of new CADe tools with fewer false-positive results per examination. Classical machine learning and deep-learning methods were also used for pulmonary nodule segmentation allowing nodule volumetry and pulmonary nodule characterization. For pulmonary nodule characterization, radiomics and deep-learning approaches were used. Data from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) allowed the development of several computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) tools for diagnosing lung cancer on chest computed tomography.

Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed.

Radiomics has been increasingly utilized in the comprehensive assessment of the TME and cancer prognosis. Similarly, the advancement of pathomics, which is based on pathological images, can offer additional insights into the panoramic view and microscopic information of tumors. The combination of pathomics and radiomics has revolutionized the concept of a "digital biopsy". As genomics and transcriptomics continue to evolve, integrating radiomics with genomic and transcriptomic datasets can offer further insights into tumor and microenvironment heterogeneity and establish correlations with biological significance. Therefore, the synergistic analysis of digital image features (radiomics, pathomics) and genetic phenotypes (genomics) can comprehensively decode and characterize the heterogeneity of the TME as well as predict cancer prognosis. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the research on important radiomics biomarkers for predicting the TME, emphasizing the interplay between radiomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and pathomics, as well as the application of multiomics in decoding the TME and predicting cancer prognosis.

This would be of great value in cancer screening programs. By using AI algorithms, data from digital images from radiology and pathology that are imperceptible to the human eye can be identified (radiomics and pathomics).

In addition, patients with HCC often distribute at different stages and require diverse treatment options at each stage. Due to the variability in tumor sensitivity to different therapies, determining the optimal treatment approach can be challenging for clinicians prior to treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, including radiomics and deep learning approaches, has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the spectrum of HCC clinical care by predicting biological characteristics and prognosis in the medical imaging field. The radiomics approach utilizes handcrafted features derived from specific mathematical formulas to construct various machine-learning models for medical applications. In terms of the deep learning approach, convolutional neural network models are developed to achieve high classification performance based on automatic feature extraction from images. Magnetic resonance imaging offers the advantage of superior tissue resolution and functional information. This comprehensive evaluation plays a vital role in the accurate assessment and effective treatment planning for HCC patients. Recent studies have applied radiomics and deep learning approaches to develop AI-enabled models to improve accuracy in predicting biological characteristics and prognosis, such as microvascular invasion and tumor recurrence. Although AI-enabled models have demonstrated promising potential in HCC with biological characteristics and prognosis prediction with high performance, one of the biggest challenges, interpretability, has hindered their implementation in clinical practice. In the future, continued research is needed to improve the interpretability of AI-enabled models, including aspects such as domain knowledge, novel algorithms, and multi-dimension data sources.

A DL radiomics nomogram was developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Model performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the log-rank test was used to analyze recurrence-free survival. Results A total of 262 patients were included (mean age, 54 years ± 12 [SD]; 225 men [86%]; training data set, <i>n</i> = 146 [56%]; internal test data set, <i>n</i> = 35 [13%]; external test data set, <i>n</i> = 81 [31%]). The DL radiomics nomogram better predicted MTM than the clinical-radiologic model (AUC = 0.91 vs 0.77, respectively, for the training set [<i>P</i> < .001], 0.87 vs 0.72 for the internal test data set [<i>P</i> = .04], and 0.89 vs 0.79 for the external test data set [<i>P</i> = .02]), with similar sensitivity (80% vs 87%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .63) and higher specificity (90% vs 63%; <i>P</i> < .001) in the external test data set. The predicted positive MTM groups based on the DL radiomics nomogram had shorter recurrence-free survival than predicted negative MTM groups in all three data sets (training data set, <i>P</i> = .04; internal test data set, <i>P</i> = .01; and external test data set, <i>P</i> = .03). Conclusion A DL radiomics nomogram derived from multiparametric DECT accurately predicted the MTM subtype in patients with HCC. \xa9 RSNA, 2023 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Chu and Fishman in this issue.', 'PMID': '37606573', 'DOI': '10.1148/radiol.230255', 'Journal_Title': 'Radiology', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Radiology', 'Journal_Score': 'None', 'ISSN': '1527-1315', 'ArticleDate': '2023-08', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606573/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'MRI-based deep learning and radiomics for prediction of occult cervical lymph node metastasis and prognosis in early-stage oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a diagnostic study.', 'Abstract': 'The incidence of occult cervical lymph node metastases (OCLNM) is reported to be 20-30% in early-stage oral cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.

However, the evaluation of the overall adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in patients with a high risk of recurrence is challenging. Radiological images can represent a source of data that can be analyzed by using automated computer-based techniques, working on numerical information coded within Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files: This image numerical analysis has been named "radiomics". Radiomics allows the extraction of quantitative features from radiological images, mainly invisible to the naked eye, that can be further analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms. Radiomics is expanding in oncology to either understand tumor biology or for the development of imaging biomarkers for diagnosis, staging, and prognosis, prediction of treatment response and diseases monitoring and surveillance. Several efforts have been made to develop radiomics signatures for colorectal cancer patient using computed tomography (CT) images with different aims: The preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis, detecting <i>BRAF</i> and <i>RAS</i> gene mutations. Moreover, the use of delta-radiomics allows the analysis of variations of the radiomics parameters extracted from CT scans performed at different timepoints. Most published studies concerning radiomics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mainly focused on the response of advanced tumors that underwent neoadjuvant therapy. Nodes status is the main determinant of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, several radiomics model based on MRI, especially on T2-weighted images and ADC maps, for the preoperative prediction of nodes metastasis in rectal cancer has been developed. Current studies mostly focused on the applications of radiomics in positron emission tomography/CT for the prediction of survival after curative surgical resection and assessment of response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Since colorectal liver metastases develop in about 25% of patients with colorectal carcinoma, the main diagnostic tasks of radiomics should be the detection of synchronous and metachronous lesions. Radiomics could be an additional tool in clinical setting, especially in identifying patients with high-risk disease. Nevertheless, radiomics has numerous shortcomings that make daily use extremely difficult.

However, the lack of standardized definitions and validated reference values have hampered clinical use. Purpose To standardize a set of 174 radiomic features. Materials and Methods Radiomic features were assessed in three phases. In phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174 features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics software implementations computed feature values directly from a digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches, moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized features. Results Consensus on reference values was initially weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8%) at phase I and 703 of 1075 features (65.4%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4%) at phase I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4%) at phase II. Strong or better consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1%) at phase I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of 174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with PET; and 164 with MRI).

In this special report, teams of researchers who developed radiomics software participated in a three-phase study (September 2020 to December 2022) to establish a standardized set of filters. The first two phases focused on finding reference filtered images and reference feature values for commonly used convolutional filters: mean, Laplacian of Gaussian, Laws and Gabor kernels, separable and nonseparable wavelets (including decomposed forms), and Riesz transformations. In the first phase, 15 teams used digital phantoms to establish 33 reference filtered images of 36 filter configurations. In phase 2, 11 teams used a chest CT image to derive reference values for 323 of 396 features computed from filtered images using 22 filter and image processing configurations.

Reproducibility of standardized convolutional filters was validated on a public data set of multimodal imaging (CT, fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) in 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma.

In this review, we address the technical requirements of PET/MRI including protocols and tracers, the potential of integrated localized breast PET/MRI exams, and possible applications of whole-body PET/MRI in breast cancer patients. Currently, PET/MRI can be performed on sequential and integrated PET/MRI scanners but, as not all practices can access these dedicated machines, several studies look at PET and MRI exams that are performed separately on separate scanners within a short time frame. This practice likely provides similar clinical data, although exact colocalization for iso-voxel analysis, currently performed only in research, is not possible. In PET/MRI, the MRI sequences are flexible and can be customized according to the aim of the exam. The most commonly used radiotracer is <sup>18</sup> F-FDG; however, tracers that image hypoxia and drug targets such as estrogen receptors and HER2 are in development and may increase the utility of PET/MRI. For dedicated breast PET/MRI, a potential advantage over standard breast MRI alone may be the complementary sensitivities of MRI for extent of disease within the breast and PET for axillary and internal mammary nodal metastases. Moreover, layers of multiparametric MRI and PET metrics derived from the index lesion are being investigated as predictors of response to neoadjuvant therapy. These data may eventually be able to be quantified and mined in a way that furthers radiomics and also precision medicine. Finally, in whole-body imaging of breast cancer patients, single-institution studies have found that PET/MRI detects more metastases than PET at about half the radiation dose, although a survival benefit has not been shown. For now, whole-body PET/MRI in breast cancer patients may be most relevant for young patients who may undergo serial surveillance exams. Level of Evidence: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn.

Radiomics data are in a mineable form that can be used to build descriptive and predictive models relating image features to phenotypes or gene-protein signatures. The core hypothesis of radiomics is that these models, which can include biological or medical data, can provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information. The radiomics enterprise can be divided into distinct processes, each with its own challenges that need to be overcome: (a) image acquisition and reconstruction, (b) image segmentation and rendering, (c) feature extraction and feature qualification and (d) databases and data sharing for eventual (e) ad hoc informatics analyses. Each of these individual processes poses unique challenges. For example, optimum protocols for image acquisition and reconstruction have to be identified and harmonized. Also, segmentations have to be robust and involve minimal operator input. Features have to be generated that robustly reflect the complexity of the individual volumes, but cannot be overly complex or redundant. Furthermore, informatics databases that allow incorporation of image features and image annotations, along with medical and genetic data, have to be generated. Finally, the statistical approaches to analyze these data have to be optimized, as radiomics is not a mature field of study.

Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs.

The radiomics workflow involves image acquisition and pre-processing, region of interest segmentation, feature extraction, and then model training and validation. It has generated promising results, however, clinical implementation for early detection remains a challenge. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common pancreatic cancer, has a highly aggressive nature with an aggregated 5-year survival rate of only 13%. Early detection of PDAC provides timely surgical intervention, hoping for improved survival rates. Radiomics has been applied to the detection of PDAC; however, its sensitivity to variations in image acquisition parameters has posed significant challenges, limiting the development of robust and generalizable models. This review explores the current landscape of radiomics for the early detection of PDAC, highlighting key challenges within the radiomics workflow and barriers to its progression from a proof-of-concept into clinical practice.', 'PMID': '40632579', 'DOI': '10.1177/08465371251351810', 'Journal_Title': "Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes", 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Can Assoc Radiol J', 'Journal_Score': '5.72972972972973', 'ISSN': '1488-2361', 'ArticleDate': '2025-07-09', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40632579/', 'Level': 2}]}, {'biorxiv': [], 'medrxiv': [], 'pubmed': [{'Title': 'The Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative: Standardized Convolutional Filters for Reproducible Radiomics and Enhanced Clinical Insights.', 'Abstract': 'Filters are commonly used to enhance specific structures and patterns in images, such as vessels or peritumoral regions, to enable clinical insights beyond the visible image using radiomics. However, their lack of standardization restricts reproducibility and clinical translation of radiomics decision support tools. In this special report, teams of researchers who developed radiomics software participated in a three-phase study (September 2020 to December 2022) to establish a standardized set of filters. The first two phases focused on finding reference filtered images and reference feature values for commonly used convolutional filters: mean, Laplacian of Gaussian, Laws and Gabor kernels, separable and nonseparable wavelets (including decomposed forms), and Riesz transformations. In the first phase, 15 teams used digital phantoms to establish 33 reference filtered images of 36 filter configurations. In phase 2, 11 teams used a chest CT image to derive reference values for 323 of 396 features computed from filtered images using 22 filter and image processing configurations. Reference filtered images and feature values for Riesz transformations were not established. Reproducibility of standardized convolutional filters was validated on a public data set of multimodal imaging (CT, fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) in 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. At validation, reproducibility of 486 features computed from filtered images using nine configurations × three imaging modalities was assessed using the lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients. Out of 486 features, 458 were found to be reproducible across nine teams with lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.75. In conclusion, eight filter types were standardized with reference filtered images and reference feature values for verifying and calibrating radiomics software packages.
