In this study, we conduct comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on fibroblast cells from 517 human samples, spanning 11 tissue types and diverse pathological states. We identify distinct fibroblast subpopulations with universal and tissue-specific characteristics. Pathological conditions lead to significant shifts in fibroblast compositions, including the expansion of immune-modulating fibroblasts during inflammation and tissue-remodeling myofibroblasts in cancer. Within the myofibroblast category, we identify four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations originating from different developmental origins, with LRRC15<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts displaying terminally differentiated features. Both LRRC15<sup>+</sup> and MMP1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts demonstrate pro-tumor potential that contribute to the immune-excluded and immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs), whereas PI16<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts show potential anti-tumor functions in adjacent non-cancerous regions.

Analysis revealed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as the major producers of ECM and the increased infiltration of its subset FAP+ fibroblasts in fibrotic sites, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.

Furthermore, specific knockout or pharmacological inhibition of TWIST1, which was highly expressed by FAP+ fibroblasts, could significantly ameliorate fibrosis in mice.

Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched 'ECM-secreting' (Csmd1-expressing) and 'pro-resolving' (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial-transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu.

Here, we explored the characteristics of LN-Fbs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the interactions between fibroblasts and ESCC tumor cells in metastatic lymph nodes. Fibroblasts were isolated from tumor, nontumor and metastatic lymph node tissues from different patients with ESCC. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on the fibroblasts. Tumor growth and drug-resistance assays were carried out, and characteristics of T-Fbs, N-Fbs and LN-Fbs were determined. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assay the culture medium of fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that fibroblasts derived from different tissues had different characteristics. Coculture with LN-Fbs conditioned medium inhibited ESCC tumor cell growth and induced chemoresistance in ESCC cells. LN-Fbs induced chemoresistance to cisplatin in ESCC cells by secreting PI16. Coculture with LN-Fbs conditioned medium decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ESCC cells by regulating the p38 and JNK cell signaling pathways. Survival analyses showed that patients with high PI16 expression in Fbs of lymph nodes exhibited worse overall survival. We also examined PI16 expression in interstitial tissues in ESCC tumor samples of patients receiving platinum-based therapy postsurgery and found that high PI16 expression in tumor interstitial tissues was an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In addition, an in vivo assay demonstrated that PI16 knockdown increased the sensitivity of ESCC cells to cisplatin. Our results suggest that fibroblasts in metastatic lymph nodes decrease apoptosis of ESCC cells via PI16, thereby providing a cisplatin-resistance niche and supporting ESCC tumor cells to survive in metastatic lymph nodes.

Modulators of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activity were identified as paracrine cytokines/factors differentially secreted between CAFs and NFs, in a mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR, IGFR, and PDGFR significantly reduced CAF-induced tumorsphere formation and anchorage-independent growth suggesting a role of these receptor tyrosine kinases in sustaining the CSC phenotype. These findings provide novel insights into tumor stromaCSC communication, and potential therapeutic targets to effectively block the CAF-enhanced CSC niche signaling circuit.', 'PMID': '30227608', 'DOI': '10.3390/cancers10090334', 'Journal_Title': 'Cancers', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Cancers (Basel)', 'Journal_Score': '3.83529411764706', 'ISSN': '2072-6694', 'ArticleDate': '2018-09-17', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30227608/', 'Level': 2}]}]
