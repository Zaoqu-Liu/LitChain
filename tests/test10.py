Surface proteins still under debate are CD44 and CD133. The structural and functional diversity of these antigens, as well as their plasticity, has only just begun to be understood. Our study aimed to gain novel insight into the plasticity of CD133/CD44, thereby proving the hypothesis of marker-associated tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic phenotypes to be environmentally driven. <b>Methods:</b> CD133/CD44 profiles of 20 CRC cell lines were monitored; three models with distinct surface patterns <i>in vitro</i> were systematically examined. CD133/CD44 subpopulations were isolated by FACS and analyzed upon <i>in vitro</i> growth and/or in limiting dilution engraftment studies. The experimental setup included biomarker analyses on the protein (flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence) and mRNA levels (RT-/qPCR) as well as CD44 gene sequencing. <b>Results:</b> In general, we found that (i) the <i>in vitro</i> CD133/CD44 pattern never determined engraftment and (ii) the CD133/CD44 population distributions harmonized under <i>in vivo</i> conditions. The LS1034 cell line appeared as a unique model due to its <i>de novo in vivo</i> presentation of CD44. <i>CD44v8-10</i> was identified as main transcript, which was stronger expressed in primary human CRC than in normal colon tissues. Biomarker pattern of LS1034 cells <i>in vivo</i> reflected secondary engraftment: the tumorigenic potential was highest in CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>, intermediate in CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>-</sup> and entirely lost in CD133<sup>-</sup>/CD44<sup>-</sup> subfractions. Both CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD44<sup>-</sup> LS1034 cells gave rise to tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic progeny and were convertible - but only as long as they expressed CD133 <i>in vivo</i>. The highly tumorigenic CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD44(v8-10)<sup>+</sup> LS1034 cells were localized in well-oxygenated perivascular but not hypoxic regions. From a multitude of putative modulators, only the direct interaction with stromal fibroblasts triggered an essential, <i>in vivo</i>-like enhancement of CD44v8-10 presentation <i>in vitro</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Environmental conditions modulate CD133/CD44 phenotypes and tumorigenic potential of CRC subpopulations. The identification of fibroblasts as drivers of cancer-specific CD44 expression profile and plasticity sheds light on the limitation of per se dynamic surface antigens as biomarkers. It can also explain the location of putative CD133/CD44-positive CRC CSC in the perivascular niche, which is likely to comprise cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Here, by single-cell RNA sequencing on 8 BC tumor samples and 3 para tumor samples, we identify 19 different cell types in the BC microenvironment, indicating high intra-tumoral heterogeneity.

Tumor immunotherapy resistance is a crucial factor hindering the efficacy of tumor treatments, which can be largely attributed to the immunosuppressive properties of tumor microenvironment. Current studies have revealed that cancer-derived ncRNAs are involved in the formation of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) through multiple ways. They not only promote the expression of immune checkpoint ligands (e.g., PD-L1, CD47, Gal-9, and CD276) on cancer cell surfaces, but also enhance the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, and chemokines).

Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies.

The spatial distribution of the CAF subsets in different Lauren subtypes of GC, as well as the neighborhood relations between these CAF subsets and the protumor immune cell subsets were evaluated by performing multistaining registration. <b>Results:</b> Tumor epithelial cells exhibited significant intratumor and intertumor variabilities, while CAFs mainly exhibited intratumor variability.

Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies.

Here we generated CAF-rich murine tumor models (TC1, MC38, and 4T1) to investigate how CAFs influence the immune microenvironment and affect response to different immunotherapy modalities [anticancer vaccination, TC1 (HPV E7 DNA vaccine), αPD-1, and MC38] and found that CAFs broadly suppressed response by specifically excluding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumors (not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or macrophages); CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exclusion was similarly present in CAF-rich human tumors. RNA sequencing of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from CAF-rich murine tumors and immunochemistry analysis of human tumors identified significant upregulation of CTLA-4 in the absence of other exhaustion markers; inhibiting CTLA-4 with a nondepleting antibody overcame the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exclusion effect without affecting Tregs. We then examined the potential for CAF targeting, focusing on the ROS-producing enzyme NOX4, which is upregulated by CAF in many human cancers, and compared this with TGFβ1 inhibition, a key regulator of the CAF phenotype. siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition [GKT137831 (Setanaxib)] of NOX4 "normalized" CAF to a quiescent phenotype and promoted intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration, overcoming the exclusion effect; TGFβ1 inhibition could prevent, but not reverse, CAF differentiation. Finally, NOX4 inhibition restored immunotherapy response in CAF-rich tumors. These findings demonstrate that CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance can be effectively overcome through NOX4 inhibition and could improve outcome in a broad range of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: NOX4 is critical for maintaining the immune-suppressive CAF phenotype in tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 potentiates immunotherapy by overcoming CAF-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exclusion.

Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses.

Tumor immunotherapy resistance is a crucial factor hindering the efficacy of tumor treatments, which can be largely attributed to the immunosuppressive properties of tumor microenvironment. Current studies have revealed that cancer-derived ncRNAs are involved in the formation of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) through multiple ways. They not only promote the expression of immune checkpoint ligands (e.g., PD-L1, CD47, Gal-9, and CD276) on cancer cell surfaces, but also enhance the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, and chemokines). Cancer-derived ncRNAs could also be transferred into surrounding immune-related cells through extracellular vesicles, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells, restraining the DC-mediated antigen presentation, inducing the immunosuppressive phenotype transformation of TAMs and CAFs, and enhancing the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs and MDSCs. Herein, we summarize the roles of cancer-derived ncRNAs in regulating TIME formation and further explore their potential applications as prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets, which will help us to address the TIME-mediated immunotherapy resistance in the future.
