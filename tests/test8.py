Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME. In addition, we present current related CAF-targeting immunotherapies and briefly describe some future perspectives on CAF research in the end.', 'PMID': '34635121', 'DOI': '10.1186/s12943-021-01428-1', 'Journal_Title': 'Molecular cancer', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Mol Cancer', 'Journal_Score': '79.75', 'ISSN': '1476-4598', 'ArticleDate': '2021-10-11', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34635121/', 'Level': 1}, {'Title': 'Pan-cancer single-cell analysis reveals the heterogeneity and plasticity of cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Abstract': 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and influence cancer hallmarks, but without systematic investigation on their ubiquitous characteristics across different cancer types.

The present study aims to examine the impact of chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC patients, with a view to identifying key molecules, critical cell subpopulations, communication patterns and spatial distributions that potentially correlate with therapeutic sensitivity. A total of 16 lung cancer tissue samples were collected from a cohort of 12 NSCLC patients and subjected to single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptome sequencing.

Nowadays, with advances in technology, we are paying more and more attention to the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and intercellular interactions in this process. We also know that important elements of the TME are not only the tumor cells themselves but also other cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, stromal cells, and macrophages. TME elements can communicate with each other indirectly (via cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles [EVs]) and directly (via gap junctions, ligand-receptor pairs, cell adhesion, and tunnel nanotubes). This communication appears to be critical for the development of chemoresistance. EVs seem to be particularly interesting structures in this regard. Within these structures, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids can be transported, acting as signaling molecules that interact with numerous biochemical pathways, thereby contributing to chemoresistance.

Tumor-assoc iated macrophages are also well known for their role in the remodeling of the stroma via collagen production and degradation, with the latter being mediated by mannose receptor (MRC1)-dependent endocytosis of collagen. Here we show that MRC1-mediated collagen internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation by macrophages harboring a tumor-associated phenotype are accompanied by the accumulation of collagen-derived intracellular free amino acids and increased arginine biosynthesis. The resulting increase in intracellular arginine levels leads to the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of reactive nitrogen species.

ECM homeostasis is essential for organ development and functioning under physiological conditions, while its sustained modification or dysregulation can result in pathological conditions. During cancer progression, epithelial tumor cells may undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a morphological and functional remodeling, that deeply alters tumor cell features, leading to loss of epithelial markers (i.e., E-cadherin), changes in cell polarity and intercellular junctions and increase of mesenchymal markers (i.e., N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin). This process enhances cancer cell detachment from the original tumor mass and invasiveness, which are necessary for metastasis onset, thus allowing cancer cells to enter the bloodstream or lymphatic flow and colonize distant sites. The mechanisms that lead to development of metastases in specific sites are still largely obscure but modifications occurring in target tissue ECM are being intensively studied. Matrix metalloproteases and several adhesion receptors, among which integrins play a key role, are involved in metastasis-linked ECM modifications. In addition, cells involved in the metastatic niche formation, like cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and tumor associated macrophages (TAM), have been found to play crucial roles in ECM alterations aimed at promoting cancer cells adhesion and growth.

Currently, tumor cell-centered treatments are insufficient to eradicate malignancies, and researchers are constantly searching for better treatments. Over the past decade, the TME has been recognized as a rich resource for anti-cancer drug development. As a significant mechanical feature in the microenvironment of solid tumors, matrix stiffness is increased owing to stromal deposition and remodeling. The effect of matrix stiffness on cancer cells has been described in many studies, whereas its effect on cancer stromal cell fate has rarely been summarized. Therefore, this review discusses the relevant content and drug treatment studies targeting matrix stiffness. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biochemical and biophysical interactions between tumor cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) co-create a distinct tumor microenvironment (TME), which impacts disease outcome. In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on the physical properties of the ECM, with matrix stiffness being one of the most thoroughly investigated. The matrix stiffness of solid tumors is now commonly acknowledged to be greater than that of normal tissues. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and endothelial cells (ECs) can all respond to matrix stiffness. At the same time, our current understanding of the TME is insufficient, and an in-depth examination of interactions between ECM and cells could lead to the development of more efficient and specialized treatments.', 'PMID': '35948177', 'DOI': 'S1742-7061(22)00473-1', 'Journal_Title': 'Acta biomaterialia', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Acta Biomater', 'Journal_Score': '11.2727272727273', 'ISSN': '1878-7568', 'ArticleDate': '2022-08-07', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35948177/', 'Level': 1}]}, {'biorxiv': [], 'medrxiv': [], 'pubmed': [{'Title': 'Crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment: new findings and future perspectives.', 'Abstract': 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a stromal cell population with cell-of-origin, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, are the most essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME.

Epiregulin (EREG) is one of the EGFR ligands and is low expressed in most normal tissues. Elevated EREG in various cancers mainly activates EGFR signaling pathways and promotes cancer progression. Notably, a higher EREG expression level in CRC with wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is related to better efficacy of therapeutic treatment. By contrast, the resistance of anti-EGFR therapy in CRC was driven by low EREG expression, aberrant genetic mutation and signal pathway alterations. Additionally, EREG overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anticipated to be a therapeutic target for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, recent findings indicate that EREG derived from macrophages promotes NSCLC cell resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. The emerging events of EREG-mediated tumor promotion signals are generated by autocrine and paracrine loops that arise from tumor epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is a crucial element for the development of various cancer types and drug resistance. The regulation of EREG/EGFR pathways depends on distinct oncogenic driver mutations and cell contexts that allows specific pharmacological targeting alone or combinational treatment for tailored therapy. Novel strategies targeting EREG/EGFR, tumor-associated macrophages, and alternative activation oncoproteins are under development or undergoing clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the clinical outcomes of EREG expression and the interaction of this ligand in the TME. The EREG/EGFR pathway may be a potential target and may be combined with other driver mutation targets to combat specific cancers.', 'PMID': '34884633', 'DOI': '10.3390/ijms222312828', 'Journal_Title': 'International journal of molecular sciences', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Int J Mol Sci', 'Journal_Score': '4.43055555555556', 'ISSN': '1422-0067', 'ArticleDate': '2021-11-27', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884633/', 'Level': 2}, {'Title': 'From gatekeepers to providers: regulation of immune functions by cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Abstract': 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment in solid cancers. CAFs are heterogeneous, consisting of multiple subsets that display diverse functions. Recently, CAFs have emerged as major promoters of immune evasion. CAFs favor T cell exclusion and exhaustion, promote recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and induce protumoral phenotypic shifts in macrophages and neutrophils. With the growing appreciation of CAF heterogeneity came the understanding that different CAF subpopulations may be driving distinct immune-regulatory effects, interacting with different cell types, and perhaps even driving opposing effects on malignancy.

GI cancers most commonly metastasize to the liver, which provides a unique immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment to support the development of a premetastatic niche for tumor cell colonization and metastatic outgrowth. Metastatic tumors often exhibit greater resistance to drugs than primary tumors, posing extra challenges in treatment. The liver metastases and drug resistance of GI cancers are regulated by complex, intertwined, and tumor-dependent cellular and molecular mechanisms that influence tumor cell behavior (e.g. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, or EMT), tumor microenvironment (TME) (e.g. the extracellular matrix, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells), tumor cell-TME interactions (e.g. through cytokines and exosomes), liver microenvironment (e.g. hepatic stellate cells and macrophages), and the route and mechanism of tumor cell dissemination (e.g. circulating tumor cells). This review provides an overview of recent advances in the research on cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate liver metastases and drug resistance of GI cancers. We also discuss recent advances in the development of mechanism-based therapy for these GI cancers.

Within the complex ecosystem of the tumor microenvironment (TME), activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are expanded and contribute significantly to tumor growth and metastasis and chemotherapy or immunotherapy resistance. CAFs exert a critical influence on TAM phenotypes and functions by orchestrating the reprogramming of tissue-infiltrating monocytes, thereby modulating their survival and differentiation. This reciprocal interaction between TAMs and CAFs forms a crucial axis in fostering a suppressive crosstalk within the TME, mediated by a diverse array of signals exchanged between these cell types. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and spatial transcriptomics have enhanced our comprehension of the signaling dynamics at the interface between TAMs and CAFs, including their spatial distribution within the tissue.
