It is as yet unclear, when populations respond to these selective pressures, the extent to which this results in convergent genetic evolution and whether convergence is due to independent mutations or shared ancestral variation. We address these questions using a classic example of adaptation by natural selection by investigating the rapid colonization of the plant species Mimulus guttatus to copper contaminated soils. We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance locus, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment. We assemble the genome of a mine adapted genotype and identify regions of this genome in tight genetic linkage to Tol1. We discover a set of a multicopper oxidase genes that are genetically linked to Tol1 and exhibit large differences in expression between tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes. We overexpressed this gene in M. guttatus and A. thaliana and found the introduced gene contributes to enhanced copper tolerance. We identify convergent adaptation loci that are additional to Tol1 by measuring genome-wide differences in allele frequency between pairs of mine and off-mine populations and narrow these regions to specific candidate genes using differences in protein sequence and gene expression. Furthermore, patterns of genetic variation at the two most differentiated candidate loci are consistent with selection acting upon alleles that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. These results suggest that adaptation to the mine habitat occurred via selection on ancestral variation, rather than independent de novo mutations or migration between populations.', 'URL': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/029900v3', 'ArticleDate': '2024-12-16', 'DOI': '10.1101/029900'}, {'Title': 'Modeling methyl-sensitive transcription factor motifs with an expanded epigenetic alphabet', 'Abstract': 'Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts.

Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\n\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\n\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.', 'URL': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/043794v3', 'ArticleDate': '2023-02-28', 'DOI': '10.1101/043794'}, {'Title': 'Optimal inventorying and monitoring of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity', 'Abstract': 'Comparable data is essential to understand biodiversity patterns.

Here we propose a method for the optimization of sampling protocols for inventorying and monitoring diversity across these three diversity dimensions taking sampling costs into account.\n\nWe used Iberian spiders, Amazonian bats and Atlantic Forest mammals as three case-studies. The optimal combination of methods for inventorying and monitoring required optimizing the accumulation curve of -diversity and minimizing the difference between sampled and estimated {beta}-diversity (bias), respectively.\n\nFor Iberian spiders, the optimal combination for TD, PD and FD allowed sampling at least 50% of estimated diversity with 24 person-hours of fieldwork. The optimal combination of six person-hours allowed reaching a bias below 8% for all dimensions. For Amazonian bats, surveying all the 12 sites with mist-nets and 0 or 1 acoustic recorders was the optimal combination for almost all diversity types, resulting in >89% of the diversity and <10% bias with roughly a third of the cost. Only for phylogenetic -diversity, the best solution was less clear and involved surveying both with mist nets and acoustic recorders. For Atlantic Forest mammals the optimal combination to assess all types of - and {beta}-diversity was to walk all the 10 transects and no camera traps, which returned >95% of the diversity and <5% bias with a third of the costs.\n\nThe widespread use of optimized and standardized sampling protocols and regular repetition in time will radically improve global inventory and monitoring of biodiversity.

In both mammalian and insect cells infected with Asian/American and African ZIKV strains, we observed translation of previously unrecognised upstream ORFs (uORFs) in the 5' region. In the Asian/American ZIKV lineage, ribosomes translated uORF1 and uORF2 that initiated from non-AUG start codons, whereas in the African ZIKV lineage, these two uORFs were fused into a single uORF (African uORF). Using a reverse genetics system, we examined the impact on ZIKV fitness of the expression of single or dual uORFs by analysing a panel of mutant viruses. We found that expression of the African uORF, and more significantly, the Asian/American uORF1, modulated virus growth and tropism in human cortical neurons and 3D organoid tissue, indicating that these novel uORFs contribute to ZIKV neurotropism.

However, electroencephalographic signals consist of both periodic and aperiodic activity characterized by the (1/fX) shape in the power spectrum. In this paper we investigated oscillatory and aperiodic activity differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls during a target detection task. Separation into periodic and aperiodic components revealed that the steepness of the power spectrum better predicted group status than traditional band-limited oscillatory power in a classification analysis. Aperiodic activity also outperformed the predictions made using participants behavioral responses. Additionally, the differences in aperiodic activity were highly consistent across all electrodes. In sum, compared to oscillations the aperiodic activity appears to be a more accurate and more robust way to differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the neurobiological origins of schizophrenia and identifying reliable and consistent biomarkers are of critical importance to improving treatment of that disease. Numerous studies have reported disruptions to neural oscillations in patients with schizophrenia. This has, in part, led to schizophrenia being characterized as a disease of disrupted neural coordination, reflected by changes in frequency band power. We report however that changes in the aperiodic signal can also predict clinical status. Unlike band-limited power though, aperiodic activity predicts status better than participants own behavioral performance and acts as a consistent predictor across all electrodes.

Search from memory as assessed with the Sternberg memory scanning paradigm is among the most widely studied phenomena in cognitive psychology. According to the original memory scanning model, search is serial and exhaustive.

However, data from the first session were not sufficiently reliable for identifying whether each individual complied with the serial exhaustive search model. In sessions six to eight, when participants performed near asymptotic levels of performance, between-person differences were reliable, group data deviated substantially from the original memory search model, and the model fit only 13 of the 32 participants data.

Most prior probabilistic population coding (PPC) theories share basic properties: 1) continuous-valued units; 2) fully/densely distributed codes; 3) graded synap-ses; 4) rate coding; 5) units have innate low-complexity, usually unimodal, tuning functions (TFs); and 6) units are intrinsically noisy and noise is generally considered harmful. I describe a radically different theory that assumes: 1) binary units; 2) sparse distributed codes (SDC); 3) functionally binary synapses; 4) a novel, atemporal, combinatorial spike code; 5) units initially have flat TFs (all weights zero); and 6) noise is a resource generated/used, normatively, to cause similar inputs to map to similar codes. The theory, Sparsey, was introduced 25+ years ago as: a) an explanation of the physical/computational relationship of episodic and semantic memory for the spatiotemporal (sequential) pattern domain; and b) a canonical, mesoscale cortical probabilistic circuit/algorithm possessing fixed-time, unsupervised, single-trial, non-optimization-based, unsupervised learning and fixed-time best-match (approximate) retrieval; but was not described as an alternative to PPC-type theories. Here, we show that: a) the active SDC in a Sparsey coding field (CF) simultaneously represents not only the likelihood of the single most likely input but the likelihoods of all hypotheses stored in the CF; and b) the whole explicit distribution can be sent, e.g., to a downstream CF, via a set of simultaneous single spikes from the neurons comprising the active SDC.', 'URL': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/162941v2', 'ArticleDate': '2023-07-04', 'DOI': '10.1101/162941'}, {'Title': 'Bayesian Efficient Coding', 'Abstract': 'The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brains ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. We bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems.

These problems are magnified when multi-site electronic health record data are networked together. This paper presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into composite  macrovisits.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODSEncounters were composed of data from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits.\n\nRESULTSAtomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay and numbers of OMOP CDM measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, length-of-stay (LOS) and measurement variance decreased.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can provide an alternative means of tracking virus variants in the population but is lacking verifications of its comparability to individual testing data.\n\nMethodsWe analysed more than 19,000 samples from 524 wastewater sites across England at least twice a week between November 2021 and February 2022, capturing sewage from >70% of the English population. We used amplicon-based sequencing and the phylogeny based de-mixing tool Freyja to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies and compared these to the variant dynamics observed in individual testing data from clinical and community settings.\n\nFindingsWe show that wastewater data can reconstruct the spread of the Omicron variant across England since November 2021 in close detail and aligns closely with epidemiological estimates from individual testing data. We also show the temporal and spatial spread of Omicron within London. Our wastewater data further reliably track the transition between Omicron subvariants BA1 and BA2 in February 2022 at regional and national levels.\n\nInterpretationOur demonstration that WBE can track the fast-paced dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies at a national scale and closely match individual testing data in time shows that WBE can reliably fill the monitoring gap left by reduced individual testing in a more affordable way.\n\nFundingDepartment of Health and Social Care, UK, Natural Environmental Research Council, UK, COG-UK\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSGenomic monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 variants has been introduced in several countries and shown to effectively detect the spread of known variants in multiple studies. However, verification of its alignment with individual testing data at a national scale has so far been reported only for Austria, where sampling covered around 5.4million people. Further and larger scale verifications of the reliability of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) are needed to increase confidence in its use for public health monitoring.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe provide evidence that WBE was able to closely track the spread of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron, as well as its sub lineage dynamics, at a regional and national scale across England. Our sampling covered >70% of the English population, equivalent to 39.4 million people. We thereby demonstrate the scalability of our approach to national levels. We also show how WBE is able to track dynamics in different regions of the UK and at a finer scale within London. Its close alignment, in estimated epidemiological timings, with results from intensive individual testing in the same timeframe provides evidence that wastewater-based monitoring can be a reliable alternative when large scale data from individual testing is not available.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAltogether, evidence is accumulating that WBE is a reliable approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics and informing public health measures across spatial scales.', 'URL': 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.15.23285942v1', 'ArticleDate': '2023-02-16', 'DOI': '10.1101/2023.02.15.23285942'}], 'pubmed': [{'Title': 'Multi-scale integrative analyses identify THBS2<sup>+</sup> cancer-associated fibroblasts as a key orchestrator promoting aggressiveness in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Abstract': '<b>Rationale:</b> Subsets of patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have a poor post-surgical course after curative surgery. However, biomarkers stratifying this high-risk subset and molecular underpinnings underlying the aggressive phenotype remain unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, secretome and spatial profiling of clinical early-stage LUAD samples to identify molecular underpinnings that promote the aggressive phenotype. <b>Results:</b> We identified and validated THBS2, at multi-omic levels, as a tumor size-independent biomarker that robustly predicted post-surgical survival in multiple independent clinical cohorts of early-stage LUAD. Furthermore, scRNA-seq data revealed that THBS2 is exclusively derived from a specific cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subset that is distinct from CAFs defined by classical markers. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that THBS2 was preferentially secreted via exosomes in early-stage LUAD tumors with high aggressiveness, and its levels in the peripheral plasma associated with short recurrence-free survival. Further characterization showed that THBS2-high early-stage LUAD was characterized by suppressed antitumor immunity. Specifically, beyond tumor cells, THBS2+ CAFs mainly interact with B and CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as macrophages within tumor microenvironment of early-stage LUAD, and THBS2-high LUAD was associated with decreased immune cell infiltrates but increased immune exhaustion marker. Clinically, high THBS2 expression predicted poor response to immunotherapies and short post-treatment survival of patients. Finally, THBS2 recombinant protein suppressed <i>ex vivo</i> T cells proliferation and promoted <i>in vivo</i> LUAD tumor growth and distant micro-metastasis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our multi-level analyses uncovered tumor-specific THBS2+ CAFs as a key orchestrator promoting aggressiveness in early-stage LUAD.', 'PMID': '35547750', 'DOI': '10.7150/thno.69590', 'Journal_Title': 'Theranostics', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Theranostics', 'Journal_Score': '27.8571428571429', 'ISSN': '1838-7640', 'ArticleDate': '2022-03-28', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35547750/'}, {'Title': 'Serum protein risk stratification score for diagnostic evaluation of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.', 'Abstract': 'Reliable, noninvasive tools to diagnose at-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) are urgently needed to improve management.

Exosomes secreted by tumor cells contain specific antigens potentially useful for immunotherapeutic purposes. Our aim was to determine if exosomes are present in human cancerous pleural effusions and to identify their proteomic content. Exosomes were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy was used to check both concentration and purity of exosomes. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein bands were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Western blotting. Exosomes were present in pleural fluid obtained from patients suffering from mesothelioma (n = 4), lung cancer (n = 2), breast cancer (n = 2), and ovarian cancer (n = 1). As previously reported by others, antigen-presenting molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, and signal transduction-involved proteins were present. Proteins not previously reported were identified (SNX25, BTG1, PEDF, thrombospondin 2). Different types of immunoglobulins and complement factors were abundantly present in the sucrose fractions containing exosomes. Exosome-directed specificity of these immunoglobulins was not observed. In conclusion, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation allows isolation of exosomes from malignant pleural effusions. However, pleural fluid proteins and especially immunoglobulins are coisolated and may hamper the use of exosomes isolated from malignant effusion for immunotherapy programs.', 'PMID': '14975938', 'DOI': None, 'Journal_Title': 'American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology', 'ISO_Abbreviation': 'Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol', 'Journal_Score': 'None', 'ISSN': '1044-1549', 'ArticleDate': '2004-02-19', 'URL': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14975938/'}]}
