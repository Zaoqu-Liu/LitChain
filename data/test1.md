# Sema3C in Cancer Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms, Expression Patterns, and Therapeutic Potential

## Introduction

This report investigates the role of Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C) in cancer metastasis, examining its molecular mechanisms, expression patterns across different cancer types, and potential as a therapeutic target. Originally identified as a secreted class 3 semaphorin involved in neuronal development, Sema3C has emerged as a critical factor in cancer biology with complex roles in metastatic processes.

## Fundamental Role and Metastatic Mechanisms

Sema3C functions as a secreted soluble factor that provides directional cues for cell movement, directly linking it to invasion and metastasis as key hallmarks of cancer [1]. The protein demonstrates consistent association with unfavorable prognosis across multiple cancer types including prostate, pancreatic, brain, breast, gastric, lung, liver, and gynecological cancers, with high expression correlating with advanced tumor stages and decreased survival rates [1].

The protein promotes metastasis through several key mechanisms. Sema3C induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized by loss of epithelial architecture and adoption of spindle-like morphology, with expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin and fibronectin [1]. Additionally, it enhances cancer stem cell properties through increased CD44 expression, improved sphere formation, and treatment resistance [1]. The protein also activates receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, HER2, and MET through plexin receptors, while promoting Rac1 signaling that drives cytoskeletal organization and cell motility [1,2].

## Cellular Processes in Metastasis

Sema3C demonstrates significant pro-metastatic effects on invasion and migration across multiple cancer types. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the protein markedly promotes both invasion and migration through NRP1/ITGB1 receptor binding, leading to AKT/Gli1/c-Myc signaling activation [7]. This process involves extensive extracellular matrix remodeling through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP9) and lysyl oxidase family proteins (LOX, LOXL2), facilitating ECM degradation and modification [7].

The protein also modifies the tumor microenvironment by activating hepatic stellate cells to become cancer-associated fibroblasts, creating a permissive environment through enhanced collagen deposition and cytokine secretion [7]. In glioma, Sema3C silencing significantly reduces invasion, while in cervical cancer, the protein activates p-ERK pathway signaling [11,12]. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis reveals associations with angiogenesis pathways, though direct mechanistic evidence for angiogenesis remains limited in current research [12].

## Molecular Pathways and Receptor Interactions

Sema3C operates through multiple receptor complexes to execute its diverse cellular functions. The protein binds to neuropilin receptors (Nrp1 and Nrp2) with similar affinity, which then recruit plexin co-receptors to form functional signaling complexes [15]. The primary receptor combinations include Neuropilin-1 + PlexinD1 for inhibiting pathological angiogenesis, Neuropilin-2 + PlexinA1 + PlexinD1 for inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, and PlexinA2 + PlexinD1 for pro-survival signaling in glioma stem-like cells [15].

The protein activates several core signaling pathways depending on cellular context. The Rac1/NF-κB pathway is activated upon receptor binding to promote cell survival and migration, while FAK and p38MAPK pathways interfere with endothelial cell junctions, disrupting cell adhesion [16,18]. In thyroid cancer, Sema3C enhances β-catenin nuclear translocation through Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and these effects can be offset by Dickkopf-1 treatment [18]. The protein can also transactivate multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, ErbB2, and Met in a dose-dependent manner [15,17].

Post-translational regulation plays a critical role in Sema3C function. The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, particularly at the furin cleavage site 742RNRR745 in its basic domain, with the C-terminal arginine being essential for angiogenesis-related functions [17]. Processing by metalloproteinases like ADAMTS1 and furin is essential for Sema3C activation and its ability to promote lymphangiogenesis and metastasis [15].

## Expression Patterns Across Cancer Types

Sema3C demonstrates distinct expression patterns across different cancer types with significant correlations to metastatic potential. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the protein is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues, fibrotic liver, and patient blood, with higher levels in stage III&IV versus stage I&II patients, and association with portal vein embolization and distant metastasis [7]. The protein shows predominantly tumor cell expression with lesser stromal cell expression, while being rarely expressed in normal hepatocytes and endothelial cells [7].

In colorectal cancer, Sema3C is upregulated in 5-fluorouracil resistant cells and secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts in metastatic niches, facilitating liver metastasis via the NRP2-MAPK pathway [8,9]. Cervical cancer shows widespread aberrant activation associated with poor survival outcomes and promotion of EMT and angiogenesis pathways [12]. The protein's expression positively correlates with multiple stemness markers including CD24, CD47, EPCAM, ICAM1, c-Myc, PROM1, SOX9, and THY1, while negatively correlating with hepatic lineage genes like albumin and HNF4A [7].

## Therapeutic Potential and Clinical Challenges

Current evidence for Sema3C as a therapeutic target remains limited, with no specific inhibitors, antibodies, or targeting agents mentioned in available literature. The strongest evidence comes from experimental studies where shRNA knockdown effectively suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells in vitro [10]. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests targeting SEMA3C would have minimal side effects on normal cells, as expression is predominantly found in tumor cells [10].

However, significant therapeutic challenges exist due to the dual nature of Sema3C function. Full-length Sema3C exhibits tumor suppressive properties by inhibiting lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and blocking VEGF-C signaling, while cleaved Sema3C (p65-Sema3C) promotes cancer cell survival and resistance to serum deprivation [13]. This creates a paradoxical situation where furin-like pro-protein convertases, strongly upregulated in tumor cells, convert the antitumorigenic full-length form into the pro-tumorigenic cleaved form [13].

The complexity extends to tissue-specific effects and receptor diversity. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete Sema3C to facilitate colorectal cancer liver metastasis through NRP2-mediated MAPK activation, while the same protein demonstrates antitumorigenic properties in breast cancer [9,13]. Multiple receptors including NRP2, Plexin-D1, and Plexin-A1 mediate different effects, requiring complex receptor-specific targeting approaches [13,9].

No clinical studies specifically targeting Sema3C have been identified, with all evidence remaining preclinical. Critical research gaps include lack of clinical validation, absence of biomarker standardization methods for distinguishing full-length from cleaved Sema3C, no validated delivery mechanisms for therapeutic Sema3C while preventing furin cleavage, and unclear patient stratification criteria [13]. The research emphasizes that each semaphorin should be viewed as a unique entity with roles researched accordingly, highlighting the need for Sema3C-specific clinical development programs [14].
