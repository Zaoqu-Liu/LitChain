# Review of CAF Functional Classification Systems and Spatial Distribution Patterns: Molecular Markers, Tissue-Specific Roles Transcriptomics Insights

## Introduction

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a heterogeneous and functionally diverse stromal cell population within the tumor microenvironment that plays critical roles in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. This review examines the current state of CAF functional classification systems, their spatial distribution patterns, and the molecular markers used for their identification and characterization. The analysis integrates findings from molecular marker studies, functional classification systems, tissue-specific investigations, and spatial transcriptomics approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of CAF biology and organization within tumor tissues.

## Molecular Foundations and Classification Systems

The identification and characterization of CAFs relies on multiple molecular markers, though a precise molecular definition remains elusive due to marker heterogeneity and the lack of CAF-specific proteins [1,2,5]. The foundational markers include α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) for identifying myofibroblasts, FAP (fibroblast activation protein) for specific CAF subpopulations, and PDGFRα/β (platelet-derived growth factor receptors) for characterizing activated fibroblasts. Multi-marker classification systems utilizing combinations of up to six markers (FAP, SMA, PDGFRβ, FSP1, CD29, and CAV1) have successfully identified four distinct CAF populations in breast and ovarian cancers [1].

Building upon these molecular foundations, the most established functional classification system distinguishes between myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) based on their biological activities and molecular signatures [6]. MyCAFs exhibit high contractile properties with elevated αSMA expression and are located proximal to cancer cells, primarily functioning in ECM production and structural support. In contrast, iCAFs display inflammatory gene signatures with cytokine secretion markers and are positioned distant from tumor cells, serving roles in immune modulation and inflammation.

Extended classification systems have identified additional functional subtypes including antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) that express MHC class II and CD74 for immune cell interaction, vascular CAFs associated with angiogenesis promotion, matrix CAFs focused on extracellular matrix remodeling, and cycling CAFs with proliferative characteristics [6]. However, the field currently faces significant challenges due to the lack of standardized classification criteria and over-reliance on transcriptional profiles rather than validated functional characterization.

## CAF Heterogeneity and Emerging Classification Approaches

The heterogeneity of CAFs has been extensively documented through single-cell technologies, revealing numerous distinct CAF types across different cancer contexts [7,8]. This heterogeneity has led to the development of multiple classification systems, creating confusion and limiting cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed novel approaches that leverage spatial organization as the defining axis of CAF heterogeneity [9].

Recent comprehensive analyses utilizing extensive single-cell spatial multiomic datasets have identified four conserved spatial CAF subtypes classified by their spatial organization and cellular neighborhoods across various cancer types and platforms [9]. This spatial-based classification represents a departure from traditional marker-based approaches and provides a more unified framework for understanding CAF diversity. The research community is actively working to refine these classification systems through collaborative efforts that recognize the complexity of CAF heterogeneity.

## Tissue-Specific Roles and Functional Diversity

CAF functions and roles vary significantly across different tissue types and cancer contexts, demonstrating remarkable tissue-specific characteristics. In high-grade serous ovarian cancer, short-term survivors contain CAF clusters expressing comprehensive traditional markers including αSMA, S100A4, VIM, FAP, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ, along with elevated periostin and CD36 expression [10]. These canonical CAFs create spatial barriers that impede immune cell infiltration, while long-term survivors demonstrate fewer CAF clusters expressing only subset markers, primarily representing myofibroblasts with reduced immune suppression capabilities.

Prostate cancer CAFs exhibit distinct tissue-specific roles, with CAF clusters in castration-resistant prostate cancer displaying epithelial-mesenchymal transition signatures that promote metastatic dissemination [11]. In neuroendocrine prostate cancer, CAFs engage in active immune-stroma crosstalk through significant ligand-receptor interactions with M2 macrophages, highlighting unique microenvironmental dynamics specific to prostate cancer progression.

Liver cancer presents a unique CAF landscape where hepatic stellate cells serve as the primary source of CAFs in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis, while intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma receives additional contributions from portal fibroblasts [12]. Liver CAFs exhibit the most complex functional profile, with subpopulations capable of both promoting and preventing fibrosis and cancer progression, demonstrating dual pro/anti-fibrotic and carcinogenic roles.

## Spatial Distribution Patterns and Organization

CAFs exhibit distinct and functionally significant spatial distribution patterns within tumor microenvironments that directly impact tumor progression, immune responses, and clinical outcomes. Spatial clustering analysis reveals that CAFs demonstrate preferential clustering with specific cell populations, particularly showing significantly higher spatial clustering with proliferating tumor cells compared to apoptotic cells [13]. The concept of spatial "engagement" has emerged, where cells within 15 μm distance from nucleus centers are considered functionally engaged, defining interaction zones where CAFs can effectively influence neighboring cells through paracrine signaling [14].

Large-scale spatial multi-omics analysis has identified four distinct spatial CAF subtypes that are conserved across different cancer types, exhibiting distinct spatial organizational patterns, neighboring cell compositions, and interaction networks [15]. These spatial distribution patterns create localized zones of tumor-promoting activity where close proximity enables effective paracrine interactions that support tumor cell proliferation. The spatial organization has direct clinical relevance, with high-risk patients demonstrating significantly greater spatial engagement between apCAFs and tumor cells, correlating with worse prognosis and immunosuppressive tumor environments [14].

## Spatial Transcriptomics Insights and Technical Advances

Spatial transcriptomics technologies have emerged as powerful tools for understanding CAF biology and spatial organization within tumor microenvironments. The integration of spatial transcriptomics with single-cell RNA sequencing provides unprecedented insights into CAF heterogeneity, enabling the identification and validation of distinct CAF subpopulations within their native tissue context. In chordoma research, this approach revealed endoplasmic reticulum stress-related CAF subpopulations that displayed the closest proximity to surrounding tumor cells [16].

Spatial transcriptomics has validated cell differentiation trajectories, confirming the transdifferentiation of malignant epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition into CXCL1+ CAFs, which subsequently differentiate into SFRP2+ CAFs in colorectal cancer [17]. The technology offers key advantages including tissue context preservation, multi-platform compatibility, and quantitative analysis capabilities that enable clinical correlation studies and provide foundations for developing novel therapeutic targeting approaches.

## Integrated Molecular-Spatial Characterization

The integration of molecular markers with spatial distribution data provides the most comprehensive framework for CAF characterization. In colorectal carcinogenesis, this approach revealed that ACTA2+ CAFs increased progressively from normal mucosa to adenocarcinoma, with approximately 75% arising through proliferation from intestinal pericryptal Leptin receptor-lineage cells [18]. RNA-sequencing identified MCAM as a colorectal cancer stroma-specific marker, with spatial analysis showing that these tissue-resident pericryptal stromal cells serve as the primary source of immunoregulatory CAFs that shape the tumor-promoting microenvironment.

Similar integrated approaches in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma revealed specific CAF subsets that restrict CD8+ T-cell infiltration through high expression of CXCLs and MHC-I with galectin-9 enrichment [19]. In ovarian cancer, spatial transcriptomics identified CAF subtypes and their spatial locations relative to cancer cell subtypes that correlated with long-term survival, revealing increased APOE-LRP5 cross-talk at the stroma-tumor interface in short-term survivors [10].

This comprehensive molecular-spatial integration framework demonstrates that CAF heterogeneity is not only molecular but also spatially organized, with specific CAF subtypes occupying distinct tissue niches and exhibiting unique functional properties that influence tumor progression and immune evasion across different cancer types.
