# CAF Heterogeneity in Colorectal Cancer: Subtype-, Treatment Resistance, and Precision Strategies

## Introduction

This report examines the heterogeneous nature of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in colorectal cancer, with a focus on identifying distinct subtypes, understanding their specific functions, analyzing their impact on treatment resistance, and exploring targeted therapeutic strategies for precision medicine applications. The investigation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how CAF diversity influences colorectal cancer progression and treatment outcomes.

## Theme of Steps

### Establishing CAF Heterogeneity and Subtype Identification

Cancer-associated fibroblasts in colorectal cancer represent a highly heterogeneous cell population with distinct functional subtypes that exhibit both tumor-promoting and tumor-restraining properties [1]. This heterogeneity is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks and varies depending on tumor stage and microenvironmental conditions. Research has revealed that many ACTA2+ CAFs in colorectal cancer originate from the proliferation of intestinal pericryptal leptin receptor (Lepr) cells expressing melanoma cell adhesion molecules (MCAM) [2].

Single-cell RNA sequencing studies have characterized the developmental trajectory from normal colonic fibroblasts through pre-CAF to fully activated CAF states [3]. This progression is marked by specific transcriptional changes, with intermediate states showing increased FOX family transcription factors, while fully activated CAFs exhibit elevated RUNX1, JUN, FOS, and CEBP motifs. Key regulatory mechanisms include ZEB1, which serves as a critical balancer of myofibroblastic and inflammatory functions, and SOX2-mediated reprogramming in the aggressive CMS4 colorectal cancer subtype [3].

### Molecular Signatures and Functional Roles of CAF Subtypes

The molecular characterization of CAF subtypes reveals distinct populations with specific markers and functions. Major subtypes include ecm-myCAF (expressing GJB2, ANTXR1, SDC1), wound-myCAF (SEMA3C, ANTXR1, CD9), TGFβ-myCAF (CST1, TGFβ1, ANTXR1, LAMP5), IL-iCAF (SCARA5, DLK1), detox-iCAF (ADH1B, GPC3), and CAF-S4/vCAF (RGS5, CSPG4, PDGFRB, CD248, EPAS1) [4,5].

The myofibroblastic subtypes are enriched in immunosuppressive tumor environments with high regulatory T cells and depleted CD8+ lymphocytes, and are associated with primary immunotherapy resistance [4]. CAF subtype distribution varies significantly across the four consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer, with myofibroblast-like CAFs, tumor-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs, CXCL14+ CAFs, and MT+ CAFs notably enriched in CMS4 compared to other subtypes [5].

### CAF-Mediated Treatment Resistance Mechanisms

While comprehensive subtype-specific resistance mechanisms for colorectal cancer remain limited in current literature, available research reveals several key pathways. CAFs contribute to metastasis through PDGF-activated stanniocalcin 1 secretion and IL-11-mediated GP130-STAT3 signaling activation [6]. Additionally, CAF-derived IL-6 and IL-8 upregulate S100A8 and S100A9 expression in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, promoting their differentiation into immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells or M2 macrophages [6].

### Molecular Pathways Mediating CAF-Driven Resistance

CAFs employ multiple interconnected molecular strategies to promote treatment resistance. Inflammatory CAFs utilize IL-1α-mediated NF-κB signaling to produce IL-6, LIF, and CXCL12, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and immune exclusion [7,8]. Myofibroblastic CAFs create physical barriers through ECM remodeling and TGF-β signaling, while mesenchymal stem cell-derived CAFs secrete GM-CSF to polarize macrophages toward immunosuppressive phenotypes [7,8].

CAF-derived exosomes serve as direct mediators of chemoresistance, with specific examples including miR-10a-5p-containing exosomes that directly promote chemoresistance [7,8]. The dense ECM produced by CAFs increases interstitial fluid pressure and causes vascular collapse, creating substantial physical impediments to drug delivery [7,8].

### Targetable Vulnerabilities and Therapeutic Opportunities

Analysis of CAF subtypes reveals distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Single-cell studies have identified CAF-2 as having the highest pro-cancer signaling activity, making it a high-priority therapeutic target [9]. Thirteen core genes have been identified as therapeutic targets across CAF subtypes, including experimentally validated targets like HIP1R, whose knockdown reduces tumor cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation [9].

For CMS4 colorectal cancer specifically, four key prognostic genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, GEM, TMEM47) have been identified as components of the CAFPRG model, with high levels serving as independent poor-risk factors for prognosis [10]. Drug sensitivity profiles reveal subtype-specific vulnerabilities, such as enhanced sensitivity to Nelarabine and Cytarabine for KLRB1-expressing CAFs [9].

### Precision Targeting Strategies

The development of precision targeting approaches accounts for CAF heterogeneity through several innovative strategies. ZEB1 has emerged as a critical master regulator controlling CAF plasticity between myCAF and iCAF subtypes [11]. Targeting ZEB1 represents a breakthrough precision strategy that converts immunologically "cold" microsatellite stable tumors into "hot" tumors responsive to checkpoint inhibitors by impairing collagen deposition and increasing lymphocyte infiltration [11].

Vitronectin (VTN) targeting offers another precision approach, as VTN knockout in fibroblasts significantly improves immunotherapy efficacy through SLC6A8 upregulation, reduced M2 macrophage polarization, and metabolic reprogramming [12]. LTBP2 targeting presents additional opportunities for depleting specific ECM-remodeling CAF subpopulations using fully human antibodies [13].

### Clinical Translation Challenges and Future Directions

The analysis reveals significant gaps in clinical translation of CAF-targeted therapies specifically for colorectal cancer. No clinical trials or biomarker studies for CAF-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer were identified in the available literature, with most research focusing on pancreatic and gastric cancers. Similarly, no specific information is available regarding CAF subtypes as predictive biomarkers for precision therapy in colorectal cancer.

This absence of colorectal cancer-specific clinical data represents a critical research gap that must be addressed for successful translation of CAF subtype-based therapeutic strategies. The complexity of CAF heterogeneity, including subpopulation interconversion and dual roles, highlights the need for standardized CAF subtype identification methods and comprehensive clinical validation studies.
