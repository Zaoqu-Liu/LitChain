# THBS2's Dual Functions in Tumor Immunity: Mechanisms, Checkpoint Inhibitor Responses, and Biomarker Potential

## Introduction

This report analyzes THBS2 (Thrombospondin 2) and its complex role in tumor immunity, examining its immunosuppressive mechanisms, correlation with checkpoint inhibitor responses, and potential as a biomarker. The analysis synthesizes current research to understand THBS2's functions in the tumor microenvironment and its clinical implications for cancer immunotherapy.

## THBS2 Expression Patterns and Immunosuppressive Functions

THBS2 demonstrates distinct expression patterns across tumor contexts, with particularly notable upregulation in metastatic settings. In gastric cancer, THBS2 shows significantly elevated expression in peritoneal metastases compared to primary tumors and normal tissue [1]. The primary cellular source is matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (mCAFs), which express high levels of THBS2 alongside protumoral factors like IGF1 [1].

The clinical significance of THBS2 expression is evident across multiple cancer types, with consistent associations between high expression and poor patient outcomes:

| Cancer Type | 5-Year Overall Survival | 5-Year Progression-Free Survival |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gastric Cancer (High THBS2+CAFs) | 51.3% vs 65.2% (p=0.007) | 48.4% vs 62.8% (p=0.005) |
| Pan-cancer Analysis | Consistently worse outcomes | Information not provided |

### Molecular Mechanisms of Immunosuppression

THBS2 mediates immunosuppression through multiple interconnected pathways. The protein's effects are enriched in pathways critical for immune regulation, including focal adhesion, VEGF signaling, Wnt signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions [2]. Functional analysis demonstrates that THBS2-associated genes primarily involve extracellular matrix organization and ECM-receptor interactions, which influence immune cell behavior and tumor progression [2].

The immunosuppressive effects manifest through distinct impacts on various immune cell populations:

| Cancer Type | CD3+ T Cells | CD8+ T Cells | CD4+ T Cells | Th17 Cells |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| NSCLC | Higher levels | Lower levels | Information not provided | Information not provided |
| Gastric Cancer | Information not provided | Information not provided | Information not provided | Negatively correlated (r = -0.260, p < 0.001) |
| Colorectal Cancer | Information not provided | Positive correlation | Positive correlation | Information not provided |

THBS2 particularly affects macrophage polarization, promoting recruitment and polarization toward the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. In gastric cancer, higher THBS2 expression correlates with increased CD68+ macrophage infiltration [2]. The mechanism involves THBS2 facilitating exosome-mediated M2 macrophage polarization through the RP11-417E7.1/THBS2 signaling pathway, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [4].

### Absence of Dual Functions

Contrary to the research objective's premise of dual functions, the available evidence does not support THBS2 having immunostimulatory or anti-tumor properties. The research consistently demonstrates THBS2's pro-tumor and immunosuppressive functions across different cancer contexts. The only anti-tumor effects observed were achieved by blocking or removing THBS2's function rather than through any inherent beneficial properties [7]. These interventions included THBS2 knockdown using adenoviral vectors and THBS2 blocking combined with PD-1 therapy, resulting in slower tumor growth, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy.

## Correlation with Checkpoint Inhibitor Responses

THBS2 expression demonstrates a clear negative association with checkpoint inhibitor therapy responses. In mouse model studies, tumors from non-responders to anti-CTLA4 therapy showed significantly upregulated THBS2 expression compared to responders [11]. Clinical evidence across multiple cancer types supports this finding:

| Cancer Type | Treatment | Key Finding |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Lung Cancer | Anti-PD1/PD-L1 | Higher THBS2 expression associated with poor therapeutic response and shorter survival |
| Melanoma | Anti-PD1/PD-L1 | Higher THBS2 expression correlated with poor response and reduced progression-free survival |
| Lung Adenocarcinoma | Anti-PD-1 | Low THBS2 expression significantly associated with better immunotherapy response |

The mechanistic basis for these associations involves THBS2's correlation with tumor microenvironment characteristics that predict immunotherapy resistance. High THBS2 expression positively correlates with angiogenesis-fibrosis signatures and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signatures, while negatively correlating with antitumor immune microenvironment markers, effector T cell infiltration, and natural killer cell presence [11].

## Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker Potential

### Prognostic Value

THBS2 demonstrates significant potential as a prognostic biomarker across multiple cancer types. In lung adenocarcinoma, comprehensive genomic analysis identified THBS2 as the top-ranked gene negatively correlating with both recurrence-free survival and overall survival in pathologically node-negative stage patients [11]. The prognostic significance was validated across multiple independent external cohorts, with tissue microarray data from 93 patients confirming THBS2 protein level as an independent prognostic factor.

High THBS2 expression correlates with adverse clinical features including poor tumor differentiation, smoking history, and metastatic potential. The protein's expression is detectable in metastatic lymph node samples, supporting its role in tumor progression and recurrence [11].

### Predictive Biomarker Limitations

While THBS2 shows promise as an immune-modulatory factor, the evidence supporting its utility as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy treatment selection remains limited and primarily indirect. The available research provides mechanistic evidence demonstrating THBS2's immunosuppressive effects:

- Patients with high THBS2 expression show elevated T-cell exhaustion scores and immune checkpoint gene expression [15]
- THBS2 can directly inhibit T-cell cytotoxic activity via CD47 receptor binding [15]
- THBS2 suppression enhances CD36+CD8+ T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic potential [16]

However, direct evidence for THBS2's utility in immunotherapy treatment selection and response prediction is insufficient. The studies primarily demonstrate mechanistic relationships rather than validated predictive biomarker performance, indicating that further research specifically correlating THBS2 expression levels with immunotherapy response outcomes is necessary.
