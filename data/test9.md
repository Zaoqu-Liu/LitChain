# PI16+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts: Molecular Characteristics, Clinical Significance, and Therapeutic Potential

## Introduction

This report analyzes the PI16+ cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subpopulation, examining their molecular characteristics, functional significance in the tumor microenvironment, prognostic value in cancer patients, and potential as therapeutic targets. The analysis synthesizes current research to provide a comprehensive understanding of this emerging fibroblast subset and its role in cancer biology.

## Molecular Identity and Functional Characteristics

The molecular characterization of PI16+ cancer-associated fibroblasts reveals them as a distinct subset within the broader CAF population. PI16+ fibroblasts represent one of two pan-tissue fibroblast populations that express peptidase inhibitor 16, a GPI-anchored membrane protein, alongside dermatopontin [1]. These cells demonstrate perivascular localization with predicted stemness properties and the potential to differentiate into distinct fibroblast populations [1]. In gastric cancer, PI16 serves as an exclusive marker of cluster 6 fibroblasts alongside MFAP5 and SFRP2 [2].

While specific functional activities of PI16+ CAFs regarding tissue remodeling and metabolic functions remain largely unexplored in the current literature, these cells exhibit multipotent properties as progenitor cells that produce extracellular matrix components and cytokines [3]. The functional significance of PI16 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts requires further investigation, as research focus has predominantly centered on other markers rather than PI16 specifically.

## Tumor Microenvironment Interactions

PI16+ CAFs demonstrate extensive and complex interactions with multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment, particularly in gastric cancer where they play a crucial role in shaping the immunosuppressive landscape. These fibroblasts exhibit preferential communication patterns with myeloid cells as primary interaction partners, followed by secondary interactions with mast cells, T cells, and B cells [2].

The communication mechanisms involve three distinct pathways: direct cell-cell contact through CD99-CD99 and CD44-based contacts, extracellular matrix-receptor signaling, and secreted signaling through PPIA-BSG, APP-CD74, and PTN-NCL pathways [2]. Notably, PI16+ CAFs show strong positive correlations with activated mast cells and M2 macrophages while demonstrating negative correlations with CD4+ memory activated T cells and M0/M1 macrophages, contributing to immunosuppressive environment creation and poor prognosis association [2].

## Impact on Tumor Progression

The role of PI16+ CAFs in tumor progression appears to be context-dependent and varies across cancer types. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PI16+ fibroblasts enhance tumor growth by inducing regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation through a DOCK2-dependent mechanism, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment [4]. This mechanism directly contributes to tumor immune evasion and therapeutic resistance.

However, in colorectal cancer, the relationship is more complex. PI16+ fibroblasts are significantly enriched in normal adjacent tissue compared to tumor tissue and are associated with normal tissue homeostasis [5]. The loss of normal PI16+ fibroblast function and potential reprogramming into desmoplastic fibroblasts appears to contribute to poor clinical outcomes, suggesting that PI16+ CAFs may have protective functions that are lost during tumor progression.

## Clinical Prognostic Value

Clinical evidence regarding the prognostic value of PI16+ CAFs presents a nuanced picture with cancer-type specific implications. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, direct clinical evidence from 200 patients demonstrates that PI16 upregulation in tumor stroma correlates with significantly poorer overall survival, with patients showing PI16 upregulation having a median survival of 6.33 years compared to 10.09 years for those with PI16 downregulation [4].

| Cancer Type | PI16+ CAF Status | Clinical Outcome | Evidence Level |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| ESCC | High presence/upregulation | Poor survival (6.33 vs 10.09 years) | Direct clinical evidence (n=200) |
| Colorectal | Complex relationship | Better when normal function preserved, worse when reprogrammed | Indirect evidence via gene expression |
| Other cancers | Information not provided | Information not provided | No specific data available |

The mechanistic basis for poor outcomes in ESCC involves increased regulatory T cell density and lower CD8+ effector T cell density in patients with higher PI16+ CAF presence, establishing a clear link between PI16+ CAFs and immunosuppressive microenvironment [4].

## Therapeutic Potential and Current Development

Despite the promising therapeutic implications of PI16+ CAFs, current drug development efforts remain extremely limited. The research demonstrates that PI16+ CAFs represent a promising therapeutic target, particularly in cancer immunotherapy contexts, but there is a significant gap in therapeutic development with no specific PI16-targeted drugs, clinical trials, or dedicated drug development programs reported across the analyzed studies.

The only preclinical evidence comes from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma research, where CPYPP (a DOCK2 inhibitor) blocked PI16-induced Treg differentiation in vitro and reduced tumor growth while improving survival in mouse models when administered intratumorally [4]. However, this represents indirect targeting through the DOCK2 pathway rather than direct PI16 targeting.

| Study Context | Therapeutic Approach | Results | Limitations |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma | CPYPP (DOCK2 inhibitor) | Blocked PI16-induced Treg differentiation; reduced tumor growth | Indirect targeting through DOCK2 pathway |
| Systemic sclerosis | Theoretical activation of PI16+ fibroblast signatures | Suggested as potential antifibrotic approach | No specific therapeutic strategies described |

The field currently lacks direct PI16-targeting compounds or biologics, comprehensive preclinical validation of PI16 as a therapeutic target, clinical translation of PI16-focused therapeutic strategies, and systematic drug development programs specifically designed to modulate PI16+ CAF function.

## Impact on Tumor Progression

The role of PI16+ CAFs in tumor progression appears context-dependent and varies across cancer types. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PI16+ fibroblasts enhance tumor growth by inducing regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation through a DOCK2-dependent mechanism, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment [4]. This mechanism directly contributes to tumor immune evasion and therapeutic resistance.

However, in colorectal cancer (CRC), the relationship is more complex.

The loss of normal PI16+ fibroblast function and potential reprogramming into desmoplastic fibroblasts appears to contribute to poor clinical outcomes, suggesting that PI16+ CAFs may have protective functions lost during tumor progression.

This study also showed increased regulatory T cell density and lower CD8+ effector T cell density associated with higher PI16+ CAF presence, establishing a mechanistic link between PI16+ CAFs and the immunosuppressive microenvironment [4].

In CRC, the relationship is more intricate. PI16+ fibroblasts are enriched in normal tissue and linked to tissue homeostasis, whereas expression of certain PI16-associated genes correlates with poorer survival in CMS4 tumor subtype, indicating a potential role in tumor progression upon fibroblast reprogramming [5].

Other cancer types, such as gastric and bladder cancers, as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, have insufficient data regarding PI16+ CAF prognostic implications [1,6,8].

| Cancer Type | PI16+ CAF Status | Clinical Outcome | Evidence Level |

| ESCC        | High presence/upregulation | Poor survival (6.33 vs 10.09 years) | Direct clinical evidence (n=200) |

## Therapeutic Potential and Current Development

Despite promising therapeutic implications, current drug development efforts targeting PI16+ CAFs remain extremely limited. PI16+ CAFs represent a promising target, particularly in immunotherapy contexts where they promote tumor immune evasion by inducing Treg differentiation via DOCK2 signaling [4].

The sole preclinical evidence involves the use of CPYPP, a DOCK2 inhibitor, which blocks PI16-induced Treg differentiation in vitro and reduces tumor growth while improving survival in murine models upon intratumoral administration [4]. This represents indirect targeting of PI16+ CAFs via downstream signaling, not direct PI16 inhibition.

In systemic sclerosis, PI16+ fibroblasts are hypothesized to have antifibrotic potential and promote tissue homeostasis, but no targeted therapies or clinical trials are currently described [7].

The field lacks direct PI16-targeting compounds or biologics, comprehensive preclinical validation, clinical translation of PI16-focused strategies, and systematic drug development programs designed to modulate PI16+ CAF function. This gap emphasizes the need for intensified research into PI16 as a therapeutic target.

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ESCC                         | Promotes immunosuppression via Tregs | Targeting DOCK2 shows promise       | Preclinical; indirect targeting [4]   |
| CRC                          | Associated with normal tissue homeostasis | Potential role in tumor progression | No therapeutic strategies described   |
| Systemic sclerosis            | Antifibrotic effects suggested      | Theoretical activation approach     | No specific therapies                  |

## Conclusion

PI16+ CAFs constitute a distinct fibroblast subpopulation with significant implications in cancer biology, particularly regarding tumor immunosuppression and patient prognosis. While the molecular markers and functional roles of PI16+ CAFs are emerging, substantial gaps remain in understanding their remodeling and metabolic functions and specific contributions to tumor progression across cancer types. Clinical evidence highlights their prognostic value, especially in ESCC, where increased PI16+ CAF presence correlates with poor survival mediated by immunosuppressive mechanisms. Therapeutically, targeting PI16+ CAFs is still in nascent stages, with preclinical data suggesting potential via indirect DOCK2 inhibition but lacking direct PI16-centered approaches. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise roles of PI16+ CAFs, validating their clinical relevance, and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.
