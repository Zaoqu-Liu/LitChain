# Spatial Interactions Between CAFs and Macrophages: Communication Mechanisms, Microenvironment Remodeling, and Therapeutic Implications

## Introduction

This report investigates the complex spatial interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages within the tumor microenvironment, examining their communication mechanisms, role in microenvironment remodeling, and potential therapeutic implications. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective cancer treatment strategies, as both cell types contribute significantly to tumor progression, immune suppression, and therapeutic resistance.

## Spatial Organization and Communication Networks

### Spatial Co-localization Patterns

Multiple studies provide compelling evidence for the spatial proximity and co-distribution of CAFs and macrophages within tumor tissues. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are consistently described as "the most prominent immune cells in the vicinity of CAF-populated areas," indicating that these two cell populations are spatially clustered together in tumor tissues [1]. This spatial clustering facilitates tight interactions between CAFs and TAMs within the tumor microenvironment.

In ovarian cancer models using orthotopic xenografts, clear spatial co-distribution patterns have been demonstrated, with metastatic tumors showing significantly increased α-SMA-positive CAFs co-localizing with F4/80-positive macrophages within the tumor stroma [2]. Similarly, spatial transcriptomic mapping in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma reveals the formation of specific "CAF-Epi" niches at tumor edges, where CAFs are recruited and transformed through JAG1-NOTCH1 signaling [5].

### Molecular Communication Mechanisms

The spatial proximity between CAFs and macrophages is maintained through extensive bidirectional molecular communication networks. CAFs secrete numerous factors that promote monocyte recruitment and M2-type macrophage polarization, including chemokines (MCP-1, SDF-1, CCL2, CCL5), cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-β), growth factors (M-CSF1), and other specialized factors like Chi3L1 [1]. These CAF-derived factors collectively enhance monocyte migration and promote the acquisition of the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype in macrophages.

Reciprocally, M2-type TAMs regulate CAF activation through their own secretory profile, particularly IL-6 and SDF-1, which promote CAF activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [1]. This bidirectional communication establishes positive feedback loops where CAF-induced M2 macrophages further enhance CAF activity, creating self-reinforcing immunosuppressive circuits.

Notably, while extensive paracrine signaling mechanisms have been characterized, direct cell-cell contact mechanisms such as gap junctions, adhesion molecules, or membrane receptors between CAFs and macrophages remain largely unexplored in the current literature, representing a significant research gap.

## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling

### Coordinated ECM Production and Modification

CAF-macrophage interactions lead to coordinated extracellular matrix remodeling through multiple mechanisms. When monocytes differentiate into M2 macrophages upon exposure to cancer cells, they express enhanced levels of critical ECM molecules including perlecan and fibronectin, alongside matrix-modifying enzymes like MMP-9 [6]. This coordinated expression by both CAFs and TAMs creates a remodeled matrix environment that facilitates cancer cell invasion and progression.

The interactions result in distinct stromal remodeling patterns, with fascicular stromal types showing weaker perlecan expression alongside Connexin 43+ CAFs and depleted vascularity, while reticular types demonstrate stronger perlecan positivity with sparsely distributed stellate fibroblasts [6]. This variation indicates that CAF-macrophage interactions create heterogeneous matrix environments with distinct ECM compositions.

### Collagen Deposition and Matrix Accumulation

Direct evidence of collagen deposition changes comes from studies of INHBA(+) cancer-associated fibroblasts and their interactions with macrophages [7]. Treatment with Activin A neutralizing antibodies resulted in notable reductions in collagen accumulation within tumor nodules, while control treatments increased recruitment of both CAFs and macrophages to tumor sites. The reduction of specific CAF clusters expressing high levels of pro-tumorigenic myofibroblast markers (including Inhba and Acta2) following treatment indicates that INHBA(+) CAF-macrophage interactions actively promote ECM remodeling and collagen deposition.

## Immune Microenvironment Modulation

### Impact on T Cell Populations

CAF-macrophage interactions profoundly reshape the broader immune microenvironment, particularly affecting T cell recruitment, activation, and spatial distribution. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, inflammatory CAFs produce chemokines including CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL12 that sequester T cells to peripheral stromal regions away from cancer cells, while the dense extracellular matrix barrier created through myCAF collagen deposition physically impedes CD8+ T cell infiltration [8].

The interactions also drive T cell exhaustion and dysfunction. In recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, CD8+ T cells showed high exhaustion and low inflammatory features in environments enriched with SPP1+ tumor-associated macrophages [9]. However, successful therapeutic intervention can reverse these effects, inducing enhanced infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells and increased CD4+ Th17/Treg ratios [10].

### Myeloid Cell Recruitment and Angiogenesis

CAFs promote extensive monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into protumorigenic M2-type TAMs through secretion of multiple factors. In triple-negative breast cancer, coculture with CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophages through the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis [11].

CAF-macrophage interactions also actively promote tumor angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms. C1Q+ TAMs demonstrate specific angiogenic activity, while enhanced VEGF production results from the cooperative relationship between these cell types [1]. SPP1+ CD209low TAMs in recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma showed particularly high angiogenic ability, with distinct subpopulations harboring specialized angiogenic functions [9].

## Tumor Progression and Therapeutic Resistance

### Mechanisms of Tumor Growth Promotion

The evidence establishes compelling links between CAF-macrophage crosstalk and tumor progression across multiple cancer types. In glioblastoma, CAFs induce M2 macrophage polarization by producing extra domain A (EDA) fibronectin that binds to macrophage TLR4, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that enhances glioblastoma stem cell enrichment and activates cancer progression pathways including HIF-1α and EMT [12]. In vivo experiments demonstrated that supplementing glioblastoma stem cell-derived xenografts with CAFs significantly enhanced tumor growth and reduced survival in mice.

### Spatial Organization and Clinical Outcomes

The spatial colocalization patterns of CAFs and macrophages significantly influence tumor progression outcomes. In glioblastoma, CAFs spatially colocalize with M2 protumoral macrophages in the perivascular niche, where they maintain a supportive microenvironment for glioblastoma stem cells [12]. Research across 10 cancer types identified four distinct spatial CAF subtypes that are conserved across cancer types and exhibit distinct spatial organizational patterns, neighboring cell compositions, and interaction networks that shape tumor microenvironment characteristics and patient survival [13].

### Therapeutic Response Patterns

CAF-macrophage interactions critically determine therapeutic response patterns. In non-small cell lung cancer, treatment-responsive patients showed spatial colocalization between SELENOP-macrophages and antigen-presenting CAFs at tumor boundaries, with enhanced communication through cholesterol, interleukin, chemokine, and HLA pathways facilitating T-cell recruitment and antigen presentation [10]. Conversely, in non-responders, matrix CAFs predominantly colocalized with tumor cells and communicated with immunosuppressive macrophage subtypes through apolipoprotein signaling pathways, supporting tumor growth and immune evasion.

## Therapeutic Strategies and Clinical Applications

### Current Therapeutic Approaches

The interaction between CAFs and macrophages represents a critical therapeutic target, as CAFs actively promote tumor progression by recruiting monocytes and facilitating their differentiation into protumorigenic M2-type macrophages [1]. Several therapeutic strategies have shown promise in clinical settings.

IL-6/JAK-STAT3 pathway inhibition using tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated the ability to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by stimulating CD8+ T cell activation and increasing IFN-γ and TNF-α production in Phase I clinical trials [1]. Similarly, CCL2-CCR2 signaling axis inhibition using CCX872 in combination with FOLFIRINOX has shown significant reduction in tumor-infiltrating macrophages and regulatory T cells, increased effector T lymphocytes, and enhanced antitumor immunity in pancreatic cancer [1].

### Combination Therapeutic Strategies

Therapies combining IL-6/JAK/STAT3 targeting with immune checkpoint inhibitors show enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to monotherapies, suggesting that disrupting CAF-macrophage communication can effectively reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment toward anti-tumor immunity [1]. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of CAF subtypes is critical for developing targeted therapeutic approaches that can effectively modulate CAF-macrophage interactions across different tumor contexts [13].

The presence of both TAMs and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment is associated with poor prognosis and failure of chemotherapeutic agents, as these cells form a protective barrier around tumor cells that shields them from toxic agents and immune surveillance [14]. Therefore, targeting CAFs and TAMs represents an essential approach to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer agents, whether conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or immunotherapies.
