# Suitability of Affinity Column-Mediated Immunoassay as an Alternative to Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay for Blood Tacrolimus Assay

## Introduction

Tacrolimus is a cornerstone immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplantation, yet its narrow therapeutic index demands precise blood-level monitoring to balance efficacy against toxicity. After the 2009 discontinuation of the widely used microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), laboratories adopted the affinity column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) as a replacement. This report synthesizes the available evidence to determine whether ACMIA is analytically and clinically suitable as an alternative to MEIA for tacrolimus measurement.

## Theme of Steps

### Clinical Stakes of Tacrolimus Measurement

Accurate tacrolimus quantification is not merely a technical requirement but a clinical imperative. Under-exposure predisposes transplant recipients to acute or chronic rejection, while over-exposure precipitates nephrotoxicity, central neurotoxicity, and life-threatening infections [1]. Because tacrolimus exhibits large inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic-drug-monitoring (TDM) guides dose individualisation, especially during the early post-transplant period when the risk of graft loss or toxicity is highest [1].

### Historical Context and Method Transition

MEIA was the standard immunoassay until its supplier discontinued it in 2009 [1]. ACMIA was introduced as the immediate successor, offering full automation that eliminates MEIA’s manual methanol precipitation and centrifugation steps, thereby shortening turnaround time and reducing operator-dependent variability [3]. However, the transition occurred without a comprehensive, head-to-head analytical comparison using identical patient samples.

### Analytical Performance Profiles

#### Precision and Correlation
A direct comparison of 154 samples from kidney and liver recipients showed strong correlation between ACMIA and MEIA (r = 0.84) and no systematic bias by Bland-Altman analysis [3]. Both methods achieved clinically acceptable precision: MEIA coefficients of variation (CVs) ranged from 7.8 % to 9.1 %, while ACMIA CVs were 7.3 % to 9.1 % [3]. These data suggest equivalence in routine precision.

#### Bias Relative to LC-MS/MS
When LC-MS/MS is used as the reference, ACMIA exhibits a **negative bias across the entire tacrolimus concentration range** and larger root-mean-square prediction errors than MEIA ever displayed [1]. Part of this bias is attributed to automated sample handling that allows erythrocyte sedimentation and variable processing times, effectively lowering measured concentrations [1]. Thus, while ACMIA correlates well with MEIA, both may deviate from the gold-standard LC-MS/MS in different directions.

### Interference and Cross-Reactivity

#### Tacrolimus Metabolites
ACMIA’s monoclonal antibody shows **15 %, 3 % and 1 % cross-reactivity with tacrolimus metabolites M-I, M-II and M-III**, respectively, indicating high specificity for the parent drug [1]. Nevertheless, when all metabolites are considered collectively, ACMIA yields a **positive mean bias of 1.78 ng/mL versus LC-MS/MS** [2]. Comparable quantitative cross-reactivity data for MEIA are not available in the provided literature, precluding a definitive comparison.

#### Endogenous Substances
Both assays are largely free from interference by hematocrit, albumin, bilirubin, or creatinine under routine conditions [3]. However, ACMIA demonstrates **larger positive bias in liver-transplant recipients and in patients with hypoalbuminaemia**, particularly during the early post-transplant phase [2]. These findings underscore the need for cautious interpretation of ACMIA results in specific clinical sub-populations.

### Clinical Concordance and TDM Decision-Making

Despite the analytical data, **no published study provides Bland-Altman or Passing-Bablok analyses comparing ACMIA or MEIA directly to LC-MS/MS using the same patient cohort** [4]. Consequently, the impact of any bias on actual TDM decisions—such as dose adjustments or rejection-risk stratification—remains unquantified. The absence of such clinical-validation data represents a critical knowledge gap.

### Summary Assessment

| Criterion | MEIA | ACMIA | Evidence Quality |
|-----------|------|--------|------------------|
| **Precision (CV)** | 7.8–9.1 % | 7.3–9.1 % | Direct comparison available [3] |
| **Bias vs LC-MS/MS** | Not reported | Negative bias across range | Limited to ACMIA [1] |
| **Metabolite cross-reactivity** | Not quantified | 15 % (M-I), 3 % (M-II), 1 % (M-III) | ACMIA only [1,2] |
| **Endogenous interference** | Minimal | Enhanced bias with low albumin | ACMIA only [2,3] |
| **Clinical concordance vs LC-MS/MS** | Not reported | Not reported | Data absent [4] |

While ACMIA matches MEIA in routine precision and offers operational advantages through full automation, its negative bias relative to LC-MS/MS and susceptibility to hypoalbuminaemia-related interference raise unresolved questions about clinical suitability. The lack of direct MEIA-ACMIA comparisons against LC-MS/MS and the absence of metabolite cross-reactivity data for MEIA prevent a definitive conclusion.
