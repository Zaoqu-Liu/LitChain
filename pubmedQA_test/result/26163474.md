# Sublingual Varices and Hypertension: A Synthesis of Current Evidence

## Introduction
The present report addresses the question of whether a clinically relevant connection exists between sublingual varices (SLVs) and systemic hypertension. To answer this, we synthesize findings on (1) the clinical identifiability of SLVs, (2) the prevalence of hypertension in individuals with SLVs, and (3) the mechanistic plausibility that chronic hypertension could produce venous changes in the sublingual mucosa.

## Theme of Steps

### 1. Sublingual Varices as Identifiable Clinical Entities
SLVs are soft, compressible, bluish-purple vascular lesions located on the ventral or lateral tongue that can be reliably diagnosed by diascopy [2]. They present as dilated, tortuous, irregular, or bubble-shaped veins that are usually asymptomatic and benign [3]. Inter-rater reliability among oral medicine specialists is high (κ = 0.84), confirming that SLVs are both readily identifiable and quantifiable [3].

### 2. Prevalence of Hypertension in Individuals with Sublingual Varices
Two large observational studies report conflicting prevalence data. In a cohort of 478 nursing-home seniors, no significant association was found between SLVs and hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg; P = 0.8) [2]. Conversely, a study of 500 outpatients found that 77 % of those with SLVs had hypertension versus only 14.8 % of those without SLVs (P < 0.001) [3]. The latter study also documented markedly higher mean diastolic blood pressure in patients with SLVs (100.45 ± 17.81 mmHg vs 80.31 ± 12.08 mmHg; P < 0.001) and identified hypertension as an independent predictor of SLVs in multivariable logistic regression [3].

### 3. Mechanistic Evidence Linking Systemic Hypertension to Sublingual Venous Changes
Recent mechanistic studies provide convergent evidence that chronic systemic hypertension induces venous congestion and microvascular remodeling in the sublingual region. In a controlled study of 120 dental patients, 86.8 % of hypertensive individuals exhibited SLVs compared with 48.1 % of normotensive controls (P < 0.001), with SLV frequency rising in parallel with advancing hypertension stages [1]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple datasets calculated a pooled odds ratio of 2.66 (95 % CI 1.69–4.18) for hypertension in individuals with SLVs [2]. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly elevated in patients with SLVs (weighted mean differences of 13.04 mmHg and 7.21 mmHg, respectively) [2]. The proposed pathophysiology involves transmission of elevated systemic pressure through arteriovenous shunts or venous anastomoses in the tongue, leading to venous dilatation and connective-tissue remodeling in the thin sublingual mucosa [2]. Additional data show that SLV prevalence is highest in resistant hypertension and increases steeply with age in this subgroup, further supporting a dose–response relationship between systemic pressure burden and sublingual venous changes [3].
